## 📖 **Full Summary**

The story centers around **Jaisha**, a young woman whose life takes a dark and complicated turn after a series of threatening messages begin to haunt her. What starts as a seemingly ordinary university life gradually descends into paranoia, obsession, and fear — a psychological thriller deeply rooted in her relationships with her sister, her mentor, and the men from her past.

### **Act I: The Change**

Jaisha studies at the **University of Lahore**, where she spends much of her time sketching beneath a jacaranda tree. Once lively and open, she has become quiet and withdrawn — a change her sister **Tabeenah** cannot ignore. Tabeenah grows frustrated and desperate to understand what’s wrong with her, believing **Arham**, Jaisha’s art teacher, has influenced her transformation.

Arham is kind, philosophical, and introspective — he teaches Jaisha to “draw the world as it feels,” not as it looks. Their bond grows deep, spiritual, and complicated. Jaisha begins to see art — and herself — differently. This newfound depth, however, alienates her from her sister and family.

### **Act II: The Threat**

The peaceful world Jaisha builds around art begins to crumble when she starts receiving menacing text messages from an unknown number signed **“Abubakar”** — or so she thinks. The messages grow more personal and invasive, hinting that she’s being watched. Fear takes over her life, and even the hostel no longer feels safe.

Her closest friend **Sara** steps in to help. Sara’s sister, a hacker, traces the messages — and the shocking revelation comes: the stalker isn’t Abubakar at all, but **Qasim**, a classmate of Jaisha’s. Qasim had been pretending to be Abubakar to torment her, harboring an unhealthy obsession with her.

When **Noor**, another classmate, warns that Qasim is planning something for that very night, Jaisha and Tabeenah panic. They try to escape but soon realize they can trust no one — not even the security guards who claim to help them.

### **Act III: The Fear and the Past**

Arham, now working abroad in Dubai, stays in touch with Jaisha through phone calls and video chats. Though distant, he remains her emotional anchor, helping her navigate her fear. He arranges for security and tries to trace Qasim’s movements from afar. But Qasim seems to always be one step ahead — his obsession turning deadly.

The sisters’ relationship reaches a breaking point when Tabeenah confronts Jaisha, believing Arham has manipulated her and made her unstable. Jaisha insists that she’s merely changed — that she’s learning to live differently, not destructively. Their heated confrontation leads to a fragile truce, where they begin to understand (though not fully accept) each other again.

### **Act IV: The Husband and the Memory**

As the danger escalates, a moment of peace comes when a **bouquet of flowers** and a **painting** arrive for Jaisha. The sender turns out to be **her husband**, who lives abroad. His note — paired with a painting from Arham — reminds her that she’s loved and not alone. It brings her brief relief, contrasting sharply with the constant threat of Qasim’s next move.

The painting — depicting the same tree she and Arham once sketched beneath — becomes a symbol of hope and resilience: even branches bent under pressure reach toward the light. Jaisha clings to this symbol as she prepares to face whatever’s coming.

But the peace doesn’t last. Qasim’s messages continue, and his physical presence at the hostel confirms that the nightmare isn’t over. Arham instructs her to stay calm, to trust him, and to wait for help — but Jaisha’s fear deepens. The story closes with her trapped between trust and terror, haunted by Qasim’s words:

> “You can run, Jaisha. But you can’t hide.”
