Jaisha sat beneath the broad, sheltering branches of an old jacaranda tree on the University of Lahore campus. Sunlight filtered through the leaves, dappling the pages of her sketchbook. She had always found solace here—on the edges of the lively student crowd, where the hum of chatter and laughter faded into a background melody. With delicate strokes, she captured the world around her—the curves of the tree trunk, the sweeping green of the grass, the sharp angles of the nearby architecture.

Her maroon dress, modest yet elegant, fluttered lightly in the breeze. A matching hijab framed her face, casting soft shadows across her thoughtful expression. Everything about her now seemed muted, as though the colors of her spirit had dimmed to match the quiet stillness she exuded.

She felt the presence before she saw it—a familiar tension in the air, the kind that told her a storm was brewing. And then, without warning, her sketchbook was yanked from her hands.

Jaisha’s head snapped up to see her sister, Tabeenah, standing over her, eyes blazing. Tabeenah’s face was tight with frustration, the veins in her neck visible as she clutched the sketchbook to her chest. Her breath came in uneven bursts, and she looked ready to explode. Jaisha stared at her, calm and unreadable, her hands resting lightly in her lap.

“What’s wrong with you?” Tabeenah demanded, her voice a razor edge of desperation. “Tell me now or I swear, I’m going to slap you. You were never like this!”

Jaisha’s lips pressed into a thin line before she spoke, her voice soft but steady. “Why are you saying this? Things change… it’s normal.”

Normal. The word hung in the air, hollow and weightless. Tabeenah’s eyes flashed.

“Normal?” she spat, her anger building, swirling in the space between them like a gathering storm. “This isn’t normal. You’re not—” She stopped herself, biting back the rest of the sentence, her jaw clenched.

Jaisha simply looked at her, unruffled, her gaze drifting back to the tree, as though the conversation hadn’t touched her at all. Tabeenah's breath caught in her throat. It was this indifference that hurt the most, more than the silence, more than the distance that had been growing between them like cracks in a mirror.

With a sudden, fierce movement, Tabeenah grabbed Jaisha by the arm and shook her, her hands trembling from the force of her emotions. “What happened to you?” Her voice cracked as she searched Jaisha’s face, desperate for a flicker of the sister she used to know.

Jaisha’s calm exterior barely wavered. She glanced down at the hand gripping her arm, then back up at Tabeenah. Her lips parted, as if to say something, but she hesitated, a shadow of doubt flickering across her features for just a moment.

“I’m still here,” Jaisha whispered finally, her voice so quiet that Tabeenah had to strain to hear it. “I’ve just… changed.”

It wasn’t enough. Tabeenah released her sister’s arm and took a step back, her chest heaving. The pain in her eyes was raw, cutting deeper than any argument or insult ever could. Jaisha’s words, the way she carried herself now—this wasn’t her sister. This wasn’t the vibrant, warm Jaisha who had once filled every room she walked into with her laughter, and her energy.

Tabeenah could still remember the days when they would talk for hours, when Jaisha’s eyes sparkled with life when her hands had sketched wild, joyful scenes, not the muted, somber ones she seemed to favor now. But that Jaisha was gone—replaced by someone she barely recognized.

“Why are you doing this?” Tabeenah’s voice was softer now, almost pleading. “Why won’t you let me in? I’m your sister. I’m trying to help.”

Jaisha looked away, her gaze distant, as though she was no longer sitting under the tree with her sister but somewhere far away, lost in her own world.

“I don’t need help,” Jaisha replied, her tone unyielding but not unkind. “I’m fine. Really.”

Tabeenah clenched her fists, fighting the wave of helplessness that threatened to overwhelm her. Her frustration had morphed into something heavier, more painful. It felt as though there was an invisible wall between them now, one that no amount of yelling, shaking, or pleading could break.

“Jaisha,” she began again, her voice breaking, “please… I just want to understand.”

But Jaisha didn’t respond. She simply reached out, slowly, and took back her sketchbook from Tabeenah’s hands, her fingers brushing the edge of the paper as though nothing had changed at all. She opened it to the page she had been working on, the half-finished sketch of the campus unfolding before her eyes.

Tabeenah stood frozen, watching her sister retreat into silence once more. A silence that spoke louder than any words.

In the distance, the university bell chimed, signaling the end of another class period. Students began to scatter, their voices filling the air with laughter and conversation. But for Jaisha and Tabeenah, the world had shrunk to just the two of them—and the shattered pieces of whatever bond they still had left.

“I’ll be here when you’re ready to talk,” Tabeenah whispered, though she wasn’t sure if Jaisha even heard her.

Without another word, she turned and walked away, leaving her sister beneath the tree, her quiet sketching uninterrupted.

The late afternoon sun dipped low, casting golden hues over the University of Lahore campus. Tabeenah’s footsteps echoed against the pavement, her heart still pounding from the confrontation earlier. Her sister’s cold indifference—her silence—had only fueled the fire burning inside her. This wasn’t the Jaisha she knew, and Tabeenah was determined to tear down whatever wall Jaisha had built between them.

She found Jaisha again, sitting alone, tucked in a quiet corner near the library. Her hijab shielded her face, her posture tense and inward, as though she were retreating from the world. The sketchbook was closed, resting untouched beside her, a far cry from the Jaisha who used to pour her emotions into her art.

Tabeenah stalked forward, her movements sharp and deliberate. She stopped in front of Jaisha, blocking her view of the quiet courtyard.

“I know what you’ve been hiding,” Tabeenah said, her voice low but edged with menace.

Jaisha’s eyes flicked up, surprised for a split second before she returned to her calm, distant demeanor. She said nothing, her gaze sliding past Tabeenah as if she weren’t even there.

Tabeenah’s jaw clenched, her hands balling into fists. She hated this—the indifference, the way Jaisha seemed completely unfazed by the world, by her. It wasn’t always like this. There was a time when Jaisha would have cracked a joke to ease the tension or pulled her into a tight hug. But those days seemed far away, and all Tabeenah had now was her anger.

“You think I don’t know?” Tabeenah pressed, leaning in closer. “If you don’t tell me what’s going on, I’ll make sure everyone finds out.”

Jaisha flinched—just barely. But it was enough. Tabeenah had struck a nerve.

“You don’t know anything,” Jaisha said quietly, her voice steady but brittle, as though the cracks in her armor were just beneath the surface.

Tabeenah’s eyes narrowed. Jaisha’s calm front couldn’t fool her. She had her suspicions, and now she could see the tiny slivers of fear that Jaisha was trying so hard to hide. Tabeenah’s lips curled into a cold smile.

“Don’t I?” Tabeenah said, her voice lowering to a dangerous whisper. She paused, watching her sister’s face closely. “What about that time last week, when you disappeared for the whole night? You came back, pretending like nothing happened.”

Jaisha stiffened. Her composure faltered, and Tabeenah caught it—the slight widening of her eyes, the way her fingers curled into her lap.

“I know about that,” Tabeenah continued, her words slow and deliberate, dripping with accusation. “Do you think Ammi and Abbu won’t notice if I tell them? You know what they’ll say. Where were you, Jaisha?”

Jaisha’s silence stretched, the tension thick in the air between them. Her gaze flickered with something—fear, guilt—before she looked down, her hands clenched together.

“You wouldn’t dare,” Jaisha whispered, her voice shaky now, betraying the calm she had tried so hard to maintain.

Tabeenah stepped closer, her tone triumphant. “Try me.”

For a moment, Jaisha seemed frozen, caught between holding on to her silence and breaking under the weight of Tabeenah’s threat. The air around them felt heavy, the quiet courtyard suddenly suffocating.

Jaisha closed her eyes briefly, gathering herself. When she opened them again, the fear was still there, but so was something else—a kind of resignation. She looked up at her sister, her voice soft yet firm. “I’ll tell you. But promise you won’t react, and… promise you’ll let me live as I am.”

Tabeenah’s brow furrowed, her smug satisfaction faltering. “What do you mean?”

Jaisha stood up, her movements slow and deliberate. She wasn’t retreating, but something in her seemed different—fragile yet strong. She held Tabeenah’s gaze, her eyes dark and serious.

“I’m not who you think I am anymore,” Jaisha said quietly. “And if I tell you the truth, you have to promise to let me live my life the way I choose. Without interference.”

The demand was unexpected, and for a moment, Tabeenah was thrown. She had expected Jaisha to break, to confess, but not like this. Not with this calm, this strange sense of control. It unsettled her.

“What are you talking about?” Tabeenah asked, her voice faltering slightly. “Why won’t you just tell me where you were?”

Jaisha’s expression remained unreadable, but the tension in her body told Tabeenah enough—there was more to this than just one night, more to the silence, the distance, the change in Jaisha’s entire being.

“I will,” Jaisha said, her voice almost a whisper. “But you have to understand, things are different now. I’m different now. And if I tell you, you can’t try to fix me. You have to let me be.”

Tabeenah’s frustration flared again, mingling with the fear twisting in her gut. This wasn’t the Jaisha she knew. This wasn’t the sister who used to confide in her, who used to be open, warm, and carefree. Whatever Jaisha was hiding, it had changed her.

“Just tell me the truth,” Tabeenah said, her voice tight with a mixture of anger and confusion. “I’m your sister. You owe me that.”

Jaisha sighed, her gaze softening for just a moment. “I’ll tell you, Tabeenah. But after that, you have to let me live with my choices.”

The words hung in the air between them, heavy with meaning. Tabeenah didn’t know what Jaisha was about to reveal, but something told her it would change everything. And for the first time in a long while, a knot of doubt tightened in Tabeenah’s chest. Was she ready to hear the truth? Or was she pushing Jaisha toward a place neither of them could return from?

After a long silence, Tabeenah nodded, though her heart pounded in her chest. “Fine. I promise.”

Jaisha’s eyes lingered on her, as if weighing the sincerity of her words. Finally, Jaisha nodded, her expression filled with a quiet resolve. She took a step back, glancing around the campus as though she were preparing herself for something difficult.

“I’ll tell you everything,” Jaisha whispered. “But not here. Meet me later tonight. Just us.”

And with that, Jaisha turned, walking away from her sister once again, her maroon dress trailing softly behind her. Tabeenah watched her go, the weight of Jaisha’s secret now hanging heavily between them.

Whatever Jaisha was hiding, it was about to come to light. But whether the truth would bring them closer or tear them apart—Tabeenah wasn’t sure.

The promise had been made, but now, all Tabeenah could do was wait.

The night was unusually still as Tabeenah walked toward the small café near the edge of the hostel. The city lights flickered faintly in the distance, but the darkness around her felt heavy, as though it carried the weight of the secret Jaisha was about to reveal. Her mind raced with possibilities, each one more unsettling than the last.

She reached the café, its dim lighting casting long shadows over the tables scattered outside. Jaisha was already there, seated at a corner table away from the crowd. The sight of her sister, wrapped in her maroon hijab, her face expressionless, stirred something deep inside Tabeenah—an uncomfortable mixture of worry, fear, and anger.

Tabeenah took a breath, steadying herself before sitting across from her. The air between them felt thick with tension, neither of them speaking as they exchanged a brief glance. Jaisha’s eyes were distant, her fingers lightly tracing the rim of her cup.

For a long moment, silence settled between them, growing heavier by the second. Tabeenah could feel the frustration rising in her chest again. She wasn’t here for more silence. She was here for answers.

“I’m waiting,” Tabeenah finally said, her voice sharper than she intended. “You promised.”

Jaisha glanced at her, her eyes flickering with hesitation. She looked down at her hands, her posture tense, as though she were trying to gather the strength to say the words she had been holding back for so long. The quiet stretched on, and Tabeenah’s patience wore thin.

“What is it, Jaisha?” Tabeenah pressed, leaning forward. “What are you hiding?”

Jaisha took a deep breath, her voice barely above a whisper. “It’s… Arham.”

Tabeenah’s heart skipped a beat, confusion flooding her thoughts. “Arham? The artist?” she repeated, her eyes widening in surprise. The name was familiar, though distant. She had heard it mentioned before, but only in passing.

Jaisha nodded slowly, her gaze still cast down. “Yes… Arham.”

Tabeenah leaned back in her chair, trying to piece it together. “What does he have to do with all of this? I don’t understand.”

Jaisha’s voice was quiet, and measured, as though she were carefully picking each word. “He’s… my mentor. I met him at the university. We kept in touch, and over time, he became someone I looked up to.” Her words were calm, but there was a tremor beneath the surface, a crack in her composure.

Tabeenah’s brow furrowed. This was it? Her sister had been acting like a completely different person—cold, distant, silent—and it all came down to some artist she knew from university.

“You’re a psychology student,” Tabeenah said, her frustration creeping into her voice. “How can some artist make you act like this? You’re barely yourself anymore, Jaisha. Why didn’t you just tell me?”

Jaisha hesitated, her fingers tightening around the cup. “It’s not that simple,” she murmured, her gaze distant. “After Arham left… after he went abroad for his work, something inside me changed.”

Tabeenah’s eyes narrowed. “Changed how?”

Jaisha swallowed, her voice trembling slightly as she spoke. “It was like he was still there. Inside me, somehow. His words, his thoughts—everything he taught me—it didn’t leave me when he did. He wasn’t just teaching me about art. He was teaching me about who I could be. How to see the world differently. How to be different.”

Tabeenah stared at her sister, disbelief etched across her face. “That doesn’t explain why you’ve been acting like this,” she said, her voice rising. “You’re shutting everyone out, Jaisha. You’re pushing me away. You’re not the same person anymore.”

Jaisha flinched at the harshness in her tone, her eyes clouded with emotion. “I’m not the same person,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “And maybe I don’t want to be. The old me—the one you remember—was… harsh. Judgmental. I was angry at everything, everyone. Arham helped me see that I didn’t have to be that way. He made me realize I could let go of all the things that were holding me back.”

Tabeenah blinked, caught off guard by the emotion in Jaisha’s voice. She hadn’t expected this—a confession so raw, so filled with vulnerability. For the first time, she could see past the walls Jaisha had built around herself. Her sister wasn’t indifferent. She was struggling, trying to navigate the weight of this transformation.

“And now what?” Tabeenah asked, her voice softer but still firm. “You think disappearing and keeping all of this to yourself is the answer? You could’ve talked to me.”

Jaisha shook her head, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. “You wouldn’t have understood, Tabeenah. No one would. You all wanted me to stay the same, but I couldn’t. I had to change.”

Tabeenah’s anger slowly began to dissolve, replaced by confusion and concern. She had come here ready to fight, ready to demand answers, but this—this was something different. Something deeper. Her sister wasn’t just hiding; she was trying to become someone new, someone who didn’t fit into the mold Tabeenah had always known.

“Why didn’t you tell me about him earlier?” Tabeenah asked, her voice quieter now. “If he’s just your mentor, why keep it a secret?”

Jaisha hesitated again, her fingers trembling slightly as she set down her cup. “I didn’t know how to explain it. How do I tell you that an artist—someone who’s not even part of my life anymore—has changed me more than anything else? How do I tell you that his influence still lingers, even though he’s gone?”

Tabeenah sat back, trying to process Jaisha’s words. It didn’t make sense to her—not fully—but she could see the truth in her sister’s eyes. Jaisha was different now, and it wasn’t because of some scandal or secret affair. It was because of something more intangible, something inside her that had shifted.

“Jaisha,” Tabeenah said, her voice softening further, “I don’t want to lose you. I don’t understand all of this, but… I just want my sister back. I want to help you.”

Jaisha looked up, her eyes filled with a strange mix of relief and sadness. “I know,” she whispered. “And that’s why I couldn’t tell you. You want the old Jaisha back, but I’m not her anymore.”

The words hung between them, heavy and unspoken for so long. For the first time, Tabeenah saw her sister clearly—not as the person she once was, but as someone who was trying to navigate her way through a change she hadn’t asked for.

Silence fell over the table, the weight of Jaisha’s confession settling between them. Tabeenah’s anger had drained away, replaced by a growing concern for her sister’s well-being. She didn’t fully understand what Jaisha had gone through, but she could see the toll it had taken on her.

And as the night deepened around them, the tension remained, thick with unresolved emotions. Both sisters were left grappling with the fragile pieces of their relationship, unsure of where to go from here.

But one thing was clear: nothing between them would ever be the same.

Tabeenah’s mind buzzed with confusion, anger, and disbelief. She paced back and forth in the small café, her steps quick and restless, each one amplifying the storm of thoughts swirling inside her. The soft murmur of the other patrons faded into the background as she tried to make sense of Jaisha’s confession, but nothing added up.

“This doesn’t make sense,” she muttered under her breath, her voice low but edged with frustration. “None of this makes sense.”

Jaisha remained seated, her hands resting on her lap, her eyes tracking Tabeenah’s frantic movements. She looked tired—more than that, drained—like the weight of her confession had cost her more than just her words. Yet, despite the tension in the air, she was calm. Her face was soft, her shoulders relaxed, as though she had finally let go of the burden she had carried for so long.

“I didn’t expect you to understand right away,” Jaisha said softly, her voice cutting through the thick silence that had settled between them.

Tabeenah stopped pacing, turning to face her sister with a mix of incredulity and anger flashing in her eyes. “Understand what?” she asked, throwing her hands up in exasperation. “You changed because of him? How does that even work? He’s just some artist! People don’t just change because of someone like that.”

Jaisha blinked, absorbing her sister’s words with a quiet patience. “It’s not about him being an artist,” she said, her tone steady, but there was a faint tremor beneath it. “It’s about what he saw in me… things I didn’t even see in myself.”

Tabeenah stared at her, her mouth slightly open, unable to form words. Her frustration was rekindling, the confusion burning in her chest. Jaisha had always been the more confident one, the one who had her life in order, who knew exactly where she was headed. And now she was sitting there, telling Tabeenah that someone else had redefined who she was?

“Do you even hear yourself?” Tabeenah asked, her voice rising. “You’re talking like he’s some kind of… of guru or something. You’re a psychology student, Jaisha. You of all people should know better than to let someone have that kind of influence over you.”

Jaisha flinched slightly, but her calm demeanor held. “I thought the same thing, Tabeenah. But it’s not that simple. Arham didn’t just change the way I see art or the world… he made me look at myself differently.”

Tabeenah narrowed her eyes, skepticism lacing her tone. “And that’s a good thing? You’re shutting me out, shutting everyone out. How is that supposed to be better?”

Jaisha sighed, lowering her gaze to her lap where her hands clutched her sketchbook, her fingers tracing the worn edges of the pages. “It’s hard to explain,” she admitted. “But he made me see the walls I had built around myself. All the anger, the expectations… I didn’t even realize how much I had been carrying. And when he left, it wasn’t like he took that realization with him. It stayed. And it changed me.”

Tabeenah felt her frustration bubbling again. “And now what? You’re just going to live like this? Quiet, distant, and never tell anyone what’s going on inside your head?”

Jaisha’s gaze remained fixed on her sketchbook, her expression soft but resolute. “This is who I’ve become, Tabeenah,” she said, her voice quiet but firm. “I can’t go back to being the person I was before.”

The words struck Tabeenah hard. She hadn’t realized how desperately she had been clinging to the hope that this was all temporary—that Jaisha would snap out of it, that she would wake up one day and return to the sister Tabeenah had known all her life. But now, faced with Jaisha’s unshakable certainty, Tabeenah felt that hope slipping away.

“You don’t have to go back,” Tabeenah said after a long pause, her voice quieter, almost tentative. “But you don’t have to disappear either.”

Jaisha looked up, her eyes meeting Tabeenah’s. For a moment, neither of them spoke, the silence between them thick with unsaid words. The tension had shifted, softened, though the air was still heavy with the weight of Jaisha’s transformation. Tabeenah didn’t agree with it—didn’t like it—but she was beginning to understand that this change was deeper than she had realized. It wasn’t just about Arham. It was about Jaisha discovering something within herself that had been buried for so long.

“I’m not trying to disappear,” Jaisha said finally, her voice soft. “I’m just trying to figure out who I am now. And it’s hard, Tabeenah. It’s harder than I thought it would be.”

Tabeenah let out a breath she didn’t realize she had been holding. She walked over to the table, slowly sitting down across from her sister again. The anger that had been driving her all evening had mostly drained away, leaving behind a strange, unsettled feeling.

“I still don’t get it,” Tabeenah admitted, shaking her head. “I don’t get how he—how anyone—can make you question everything about yourself. But I’m trying to understand.”

Jaisha’s expression softened, a hint of relief crossing her features. “That’s all I’m asking,” she whispered.

The two sisters sat in silence for a while, the café’s soft hum filling the space between them. The tension that had crackled between them for so long was fading, but the boundaries of their relationship felt different now, as though they had been stretched and reshaped by everything that had passed between them.

Tabeenah could feel it—the distance that had grown between them over the past few months was still there, but it wasn’t as sharp or as painful as before. There was something else now, something that felt more like understanding, even if it wasn’t complete.

“So what now?” Tabeenah asked quietly, breaking the silence. “What are you going to do?”

Jaisha sighed, leaning back in her chair, her hands resting on her sketchbook. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “I’m still trying to figure that out. But… I’m not going to hide anymore. Not from you, at least.”

Tabeenah nodded slowly, a small sense of relief settling in her chest. It wasn’t the resolution she had hoped for, but it was something. It was a start.

As the night wore on, the sisters sat together in the quiet, the boundaries between them shifting, not fully healed, but no longer as jagged as they had been. There was still so much left unsaid, so much left unresolved. But for now, they had found a fragile sense of peace, a fragile connection in the midst of everything that had changed.

And that was enough.

The hostel was alive with the typical chatter and laughter of students unwinding after a long day of classes. In the common area, a group of girls sat in a circle, sharing stories, teasing one another, and exchanging the carefree energy that defined their university life. The soft sounds of giggling and music drifted through the hallways, making the usually quiet hostel feel warm and lively.

Tabeenah, sitting on the edge of her bed, listened to the faint echoes of laughter from the girls outside. She could hear Amara and Sara, two of Jaisha’s classmates, joking around about their professor’s terrible sense of fashion. “If he wears that brown sweater one more time, I swear I’m dropping out,” Amara’s voice rang out, followed by a burst of laughter.

For a brief moment, Tabeenah felt the temptation to join in, to escape from the heaviness that had settled inside her since her conversation with Jaisha. But she stayed where she was, her thoughts too preoccupied with everything that had unfolded. Days had passed since Jaisha’s confession, but the weight of it still lingered, pressing on her mind like an unseen shadow.

Jaisha had been quieter than usual—not the eerie, unsettling silence from before, but a kind of calm that made Tabeenah nervous. She watched her sister from a distance, noticing the way Jaisha would sit in the hostel courtyard with her sketchbook, her pencil moving almost effortlessly as if she were channeling something deep inside herself. There was a peacefulness to her now, a quiet contentment that hadn’t been there before. But it didn’t make sense. None of it made sense to Tabeenah.

Jaisha had always been driven, focused on her studies, and clear about who she was. This new version of her—the one who claimed to have been transformed by Arham—was a mystery that Tabeenah couldn’t wrap her mind around.

One evening, after the laughter in the common room had quieted and the hostel began to settle into its usual nighttime routine, Tabeenah and Jaisha found themselves alone in their shared room. The dim light from the small lamp on the desk cast soft shadows on the walls, and for a moment, Tabeenah considered letting the conversation from days ago remain unspoken. But the tension in her chest wouldn’t allow her to stay silent.

She glanced over at Jaisha, who was sitting cross-legged on her bed, her sketchbook open in front of her. Jaisha was scribbling something, lost in her own world. Tabeenah watched her for a moment, trying to find the right words.

“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?” Tabeenah’s voice was softer this time, lacking the sharpness that had been present in their last conversations.

Jaisha’s hand stilled, her pencil hovering just above the paper. Slowly, she looked up, her eyes meeting Tabeenah’s with a hint of hesitation. For a few seconds, she didn’t respond, as if she were carefully considering how much to reveal.

“Because I didn’t know how you would react,” Jaisha finally said, her voice gentle but tinged with something deeper—an old, lingering fear. “You’ve always been protective of me, but this… this was different.”

Tabeenah exhaled, the heaviness in her chest loosening just a little. “I just wanted to help,” she said quietly, her eyes dropping to her lap. “I thought you were losing yourself.”

Jaisha closed her sketchbook and set it aside, her attention now fully on her sister. “I’m not lost,” she said softly, her tone so calm that it almost unnerved Tabeenah. “I’ve found something new in me. Something better.”

Tabeenah’s eyebrows furrowed, doubt still clouding her mind. “How can you be so sure?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. “I look at you, and I don’t see the Jaisha I knew. You’ve changed so much, and I don’t even understand why.”

Jaisha’s gaze softened, and she leaned forward slightly, her expression full of a quiet conviction that Tabeenah couldn’t ignore. “I know it’s hard to understand,” she said. “But you’re only seeing the outside. Inside… it feels like I’ve broken free of something. I was always so angry, always so focused on pleasing everyone around me, and I didn’t realize how much of myself I was burying.”

Tabeenah’s heart tightened at her sister’s words. She had never thought of Jaisha as someone who was struggling beneath the surface. To her, Jaisha had always seemed confident, self-assured—maybe even a little stubborn. The idea that her sister had been fighting an internal battle all this time felt both painful and foreign.

“But why Arham?” Tabeenah asked, her confusion still evident. “What did he have to do with any of this?”

Jaisha’s expression darkened slightly, as if mentioning Arham brought a flicker of unease back into her otherwise steady demeanor. “It’s hard to explain,” she admitted. “He didn’t just teach me about art. He saw things in me that no one else did. It was like he could see through all the layers I had built around myself, and he helped me tear them down.”

Tabeenah leaned back against the wall, folding her arms as she tried to process what Jaisha was saying. “But that’s not his place,” she said, her voice rising just a little. “He shouldn’t have that kind of control over you.”

Jaisha shook her head. “It wasn’t about control,” she said firmly. “It was about understanding. He didn’t force me to change. He just helped me see who I really was.”

Tabeenah frowned, still struggling to accept it. She had spent so long believing that Jaisha was drifting away from herself, losing her identity, that she couldn’t easily let go of that belief. But now, looking into her sister’s eyes, she saw something that she hadn’t expected—peace. Jaisha didn’t seem lost at all. If anything, she seemed more certain of herself than she ever had been.

“I just don’t want you to get hurt,” Tabeenah said after a long pause, her voice almost pleading now. “I don’t want to lose you to this… to him.”

Jaisha smiled faintly, a soft, understanding look crossing her face. “You won’t lose me,” she said gently. “I’m still here, Tabeenah. I’m just different now. And that’s okay.”

For the first time, Tabeenah felt a small crack in her resistance. Maybe it wasn’t okay—at least, not yet. But for Jaisha, it was. And maybe that was something she could learn to live with, even if she didn’t fully understand it.

The room fell into a comfortable silence, the weight between them lighter now. Outside, the sounds of the hostel girls chatting and laughing drifted through the window again, filling the quiet space with a sense of normalcy. It wasn’t a perfect resolution, but it was something—an acknowledgment that change, even when it was difficult to accept, didn’t have to mean loss.
Tabeenah had always prided herself on being the older sister, the protector, the one who kept Jaisha grounded when the world threatened to pull her in different directions. But now, as she watched Jaisha sketch quietly on her bed, Tabeenah felt more powerless than she ever had before. Her sister was still here, still living with her, still close enough to reach out and touch—but it felt like the real Jaisha was slipping further and further away.

The soft scratch of Jaisha’s pencil against paper filled the room, a sound that had become all too familiar over the past few weeks. Tabeenah’s eyes flickered to the sketchbook, where another intricate drawing was beginning to take shape. Jaisha’s art had changed too. It was darker now, more abstract—lines and shapes that seemed to hold meanings Tabeenah couldn’t understand.

Sitting on the edge of her own bed, Tabeenah quietly made up her mind. She had to bring her sister back. The old Jaisha—the one who was warm, lively, and smiled without hesitation—was still in there somewhere. Tabeenah was sure of it. She just had to find a way to reach her again.

“You should come out more,” Tabeenah said one afternoon, trying to sound casual as she arranged her textbooks on the small desk they shared. “I saw Amara and Sara earlier. They were planning a movie night. You should join them—see your old friends.”

Jaisha didn’t look up from her sketch. Her expression remained serene, distant as if Tabeenah’s words barely registered. “I’m not interested in that anymore,” she replied, her voice soft but firm.

Tabeenah clenched her jaw, fighting back the rising frustration. She knew Jaisha wouldn’t give in easily, but it was hard to see her sister turn away from everything she used to love. The old Jaisha would have been the one organizing those movie nights, laughing louder than anyone else, dragging Tabeenah along even when she didn’t want to go. Now, it was like all those parts of her had faded into the background, replaced by someone more quiet, more withdrawn.

“Well, maybe we should visit home for a few days,” Tabeenah suggested, trying a different tactic. She glanced over at Jaisha, waiting for a response. “It’s been a while since we’ve seen Ammi and Abbu. I’m sure they’d love to have us there for the weekend.”

For a brief moment, Jaisha paused, as if considering it. Then, she shrugged lightly. “I’ll think about it,” she said, her voice distracted as her attention drifted back to her sketchbook.

Tabeenah watched her, feeling the weight of disappointment settle in her chest. It wasn’t like Jaisha to be so indifferent about visiting home. Their parents would be thrilled to see them, and normally, Jaisha would have jumped at the chance to spend a few days away from the university. But now, it seemed like nothing really mattered to her anymore except that damn sketchbook and whatever influence Arham had over her.

The thought of Arham made Tabeenah’s frustration turn to anger. He was the root of all this. Before he came into Jaisha’s life, she had been fine—better than fine, actually. Jaisha had always been confident, full of life, always pushing boundaries in her own way. And now? Now she was a shadow of who she used to be, hiding behind art and vague philosophies, as if she’d lost herself to some deeper force Tabeenah couldn’t quite grasp.

No. Tabeenah refused to let this continue. She had to find a way to pull her sister back from whatever abyss she had fallen into, and she couldn’t let Jaisha suspect her true intentions. If she did, she might close off completely, and Tabeenah couldn’t afford to lose her any more than she already had.

Days passed, and Tabeenah kept her observations quiet, watching Jaisha closely. Every chance she got, she tried to steer Jaisha back into her old routines—suggesting they study together like they used to, inviting her to join her and the other girls at the café, and even offering to help her with some old psychology assignments that Jaisha had once been so passionate about. 

But each time, Jaisha’s responses were the same—a polite smile, a vague promise to “think about it,” followed by her retreating into the solitude of her sketches. It was like trying to hold onto the sand; the tighter Tabeenah tried to grip, the faster Jaisha slipped through her fingers.

One afternoon, after yet another failed attempt to get Jaisha to join her at the café, Tabeenah returned to their room, her frustration bubbling dangerously close to the surface. Jaisha was sitting by the window, her sketchbook propped on her knees as usual, her pencil moving in soft, steady strokes. Tabeenah stood in the doorway, watching her sister for a long moment before finally speaking.

“Why are you so distant, Jaisha?” Her voice trembled slightly, the calm exterior she had tried to maintain cracking at the edges. “It’s like you don’t care about anything or anyone anymore. I’m trying to help you, but it feels like you don’t even want to be helped.”

Jaisha didn’t look up. She continued sketching, the rhythmic movement of her hand never faltering. “I don’t need help, Tabeenah,” she said quietly. “I’m not hurt. Not anymore.”

The simplicity of her response hit Tabeenah like a punch to the gut. Not hurt? How could she say that when everything about her had changed so drastically? How could she claim she wasn’t hurt when she’d withdrawn from her friends, from her family, from everything that used to make her… her?

“You’ve changed,” Tabeenah said, her voice firmer now, a desperate edge creeping into her words. “You’re not the same person you used to be, Jaisha. And it’s because of him, isn’t it? Arham.”

At the mention of Arham’s name, Jaisha finally paused, her pencil hovering above the paper. Slowly, she raised her eyes to meet Tabeenah’s, a strange, almost peaceful look settling over her features. “You don’t understand,” she said softly. “This change… it wasn’t forced on me. I chose it. I’m different because I want to be.”

Tabeenah shook her head, taking a step closer to her sister. “But why? Why would you want to become someone else? You were fine before. You were happy.”

Jaisha closed her sketchbook with a quiet snap and placed it beside her on the windowsill. “I wasn’t happy,” she admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “I thought I was, but I wasn’t. I was angry and frustrated with myself and with the world. I was always trying to live up to other people’s expectations—yours, Ammi's, and Abbu’s, and everyone’s. And then I met Arham, and he showed me that it’s okay to let go of those expectations, to just… be.”

Tabeenah felt a cold knot tighten in her stomach. “So what, you’re just going to keep drifting away from everyone who cares about you? You’re going to abandon everything you’ve worked for?”

“I’m not abandoning anything,” Jaisha replied, her voice still calm. “I’m just learning to live for myself. I know it’s hard for you to understand, Tabeenah, but I’m not the same person I was. And I don’t want to go back to being that person.”

Tabeenah stared at her, her heart aching with a mixture of anger and sadness. She didn’t recognize this version of Jaisha—the one who seemed so detached, so removed from everything that had once made her who she was. And the more Jaisha spoke, the more it became clear that this transformation wasn’t something that could be undone easily.

But Tabeenah wasn’t ready to give up. She couldn’t just stand by and let her sister slip away without a fight. Not yet.

“Maybe I don’t understand,” Tabeenah said after a long silence, her voice quieter now, but still laced with determination. “But that doesn’t mean I’m going to stop trying. You’re my sister, Jaisha, and I can’t just watch you change like this and do nothing. I’m not going to lose you.”

Jaisha smiled faintly, her eyes softening with something like understanding. “You won’t lose me,” she said, echoing the words she had spoken before. “I’m still here, Tabeenah. Just… different.”

But to Tabeenah, that wasn’t enough. She couldn’t shake the feeling that Arham had stolen something from her sister—something intangible but essential—and that it was her responsibility to get it back. She wasn’t sure how yet, but she would find a way to bring the old Jaisha back. Even if it meant pretending to accept this new version of her, even if it meant keeping her true plans hidden.

The weight of that decision settled in Tabeenah’s chest as she watched Jaisha turn her attention back to her sketchbook, the conversation seemingly over in Jaisha’s mind. But for Tabeenah, it was just the beginning. She wouldn’t stop until she had her sister back, even if it meant navigating the dark, unseen forces that had changed her so drastically.

As Jaisha’s pencil resumed its steady rhythm, Tabeenah’s resolve hardened. She would do whatever it took.

The soft hum of the ceiling fan spun lazily above Jaisha, providing a gentle backdrop to the stillness in the room. Seated at her desk, her psychology textbook open in front of her, Jaisha allowed herself to sink into the quiet comfort of her studies. The weight of the past few days—the confrontations, the endless questions from Tabeenah—pressed on her, but she’d found solace in her routines. There was no room for doubt or misunderstanding in the structured world of research, theories, and carefully drawn conclusions.

Her pencil moved slowly across her notes, methodically outlining concepts of behavioral patterns. Though focused on the academic task, her mind flickered back to the subtle distance growing between her and Tabeenah. She could sense her sister’s frustration, the way it simmered just beneath the surface, waiting for any moment to erupt. Jaisha’s lips pressed into a thin line. She didn’t want this tension and didn’t want to lose Tabeenah’s trust, but at the same time, she couldn’t go back to who she used to be. That person was gone, and Jaisha was only now learning to accept the changes within herself.

After a few more minutes, Jaisha sighed, closing her book gently. She stood and stretched, the muscles in her back and shoulders protesting after sitting for so long. The faint sound of laughter filtered through the hostel windows—other girls enjoying the evening, filling the common areas with noise. Jaisha didn’t feel the urge to join them. Instead, she grabbed her water bottle and stepped out of the room to refill it, taking a brief moment to escape the stillness.

As soon as the door clicked shut behind Jaisha, Tabeenah, sitting on her bed with a textbook in her lap, looked up. Her gaze shifted to Jaisha’s side of the room, her mind racing. She couldn’t shake the unease that clung to her ever since Jaisha’s transformation began. There had to be something she was missing, some piece of the puzzle that explained this sudden shift in her sister’s demeanor. Something hidden.

Almost without thinking, Tabeenah stood and moved over to Jaisha’s desk. She hesitated, her conscience briefly tugging at her, but the thought of getting answers propelled her forward. Jaisha had always been an open book, but now? Now, it felt like Jaisha was shutting her out, locking away parts of herself Tabeenah wasn’t allowed to see.

Tabeenah began sifting through Jaisha’s neatly stacked books and papers. Nothing out of the ordinary—just notes, sketches, psychology articles—but as she reached for the last stack of books, something caught her eye. A sealed envelope, tucked beneath a journal, its edges peeking out almost deliberately, as though someone wanted it to be found.

Her heart raced as she pulled the envelope free. There was no name on the outside, just the soft curve of handwriting. But when she flipped it over, she saw the signature in bold ink—“Abubakar.”

Tabeenah’s eyes widened. A love letter. She didn’t need to open it to know what it meant. Her sister had been hiding something, someone. All this time, she had been focused on Arham, suspecting his influence was at the root of Jaisha’s transformation, but now this? A secret relationship?

Jaisha entered the room just as Tabeenah was staring at the envelope, her hand frozen in mid-air. The moment Jaisha saw what Tabeenah was holding, her calm expression shifted, but only slightly. A flicker of confusion passed over her face, but she remained composed, walking slowly toward her desk.

“Tabeenah, what are you doing?” Jaisha asked softly, her tone calm as always.

Tabeenah’s grip tightened around the letter as she turned to face her sister, eyes blazing with accusation. “What is this, Jaisha?” she demanded, waving the envelope in front of her. “You’ve been lying to me. You’re hiding a relationship from me! Who is Abubakar?”

Jaisha blinked, clearly taken aback. “I don’t know,” she replied, her voice measured. “I’ve never seen that letter before.”

Tabeenah scoffed, her anger boiling over. “Don’t lie to me! First Arham, now this? You’ve been acting strange for weeks, and now I find this? You’re telling me you don’t even know who Abubakar is?”

“I’m telling you the truth,” Jaisha said quietly, her eyes never leaving Tabeenah’s. “I have no idea who he is. That letter… I don’t know where it came from.”

Tabeenah shook her head, disbelief coursing through her. How could Jaisha stand there so calmly, as though this wasn’t a betrayal of their sisterhood? “You expect me to believe that? You’ve been hiding everything from me. First, you change overnight, then you distance yourself from everyone, and now you claim you don’t know who this Abubakar is? You’re lying, Jaisha.”

Jaisha took a deep breath, trying to maintain her composure. “I’m not lying, Tabeenah. I don’t know who sent that letter. But even if I did—why would I hide something like this from you? You’re my sister.”

Tabeenah glared at her, her frustration mounting. “Because you’ve been hiding everything else! You’re different, Jaisha. And I’m trying to understand why. I thought it was Arham, but maybe… maybe it’s this. Maybe you’ve been hiding a relationship, and that’s why you’ve changed.”

“I haven’t been hiding anything,” Jaisha responded, her voice remaining steady, though there was a glimmer of something darker in her eyes. “I’ve been trying to figure things out for myself, yes, but I’ve never lied to you. I don’t know who Abubakar is, and I’m just as surprised by that letter as you are.”

Tabeenah’s hand trembled slightly as she held the envelope, her anger beginning to dissolve into confusion. There was something about Jaisha’s calmness, her unwavering gaze, that made Tabeenah pause. Could it really be true? Could this letter be some kind of mistake?

Jaisha stepped closer, her eyes softening. “Tabeenah, listen to me. I know you’re worried. I know you don’t understand why I’ve changed. But I need you to trust me. This letter… whoever Abubakar is, I’ll figure it out. But you have to believe me when I say I’m not hiding anything from you.”

For a moment, silence filled the room. Tabeenah stared at her sister, torn between the anger that had driven her and the doubt that now lingered in her chest. Could she trust Jaisha? Was this all just some kind of misunderstanding?

But then, with a frustrated huff, Tabeenah shoved the letter into Jaisha’s hands and stormed out of the room without another word. The door slammed behind her, leaving Jaisha standing alone, the letter crumpled in her hand.

She looked down at the envelope, her mind racing. Whoever this Abubakar was, he had managed to insert himself into her life in a confusing and threatening way. But she wouldn’t let this rattle her. Jaisha’s eyes hardened with silent resolve. If this was someone’s attempt to sabotage her—to disrupt the fragile peace she had found—they would not succeed.

Sitting down at her desk, Jaisha smoothed out the crumpled envelope and stared at the name scrawled across it. Abubakar. The name felt like a shadow creeping into her life, but she would face it head-on, without losing the control she had worked so hard to maintain.

One thing was certain—this was far from over.

The silence that followed Tabeenah's stormy exit weighed heavily on Jaisha. She stood frozen by the door, her fingers still clutching the crumpled letter. The name "Abubakar" stared back at her like a taunt. Her heart pounded in her chest, the frustration and confusion overwhelming her. She hadn’t lied, hadn’t kept secrets—so why did it feel like her whole world was starting to collapse around her?

Jaisha’s vision blurred as tears welled up in her eyes. She sank down on the edge of her bed, the letter trembling in her hand. Her thoughts spun wildly, searching for answers she couldn’t find. Why was this happening? Who was Abubakar, and why was she being dragged into something she had no part in? It didn’t make sense, and the worst part was that Tabeenah—her own sister—didn’t believe her.

A soft knock on the door pulled her out of her spiraling thoughts. Jaisha wiped her eyes quickly, trying to regain some composure before calling out, "Come in."

The door creaked open, and Sarah, Jaisha’s best friend, slipped inside. Her usually bright face was tinged with worry, and the tension in the room seemed to hit her immediately.

“Hey,” Sarah said softly, closing the door behind her. “I… I just saw Tabeenah. She looked upset. What’s going on?” Her gaze flickered toward the letter in Jaisha’s hand, and her expression shifted into one of concern.

Jaisha’s voice cracked as she tried to explain. “She found this… letter. It’s from someone named Abubakar. I’ve never seen it before, Sarah. I swear. But she thinks I’m hiding something, that I’ve been lying to her this whole time.” Her tears finally broke through, spilling down her cheeks as she clutched the letter tighter like it was some cruel reminder of how things were unraveling.

Sarah hurried to her side, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. “Hey, hey, it’s okay. I know you, Jaisha. You’re not the type to hide things from Tabeenah—or from me. But… Abubakar? Who is that?” Sarah’s voice softened at the end, and Jaisha could sense a sliver of doubt creeping in, even in her best friend.

“I don’t know!” Jaisha choked out, her frustration mounting. “I’ve never even heard that name before. I don’t know how the letter ended up in my stuff. I don’t know what’s happening.”

Sarah glanced down at the envelope, biting her lip. Her loyalty to Jaisha was strong, but the situation didn’t make sense. The letter was real, after all. And it had Jaisha’s name on it, the way it had been hidden—it all looked suspicious.

“Jaisha…” Sarah began slowly, “I believe you, I do. But—this letter, it’s… strange. Are you sure you’ve never come across this Abubakar guy? Maybe someone’s messing with you?”

Jaisha shook her head vehemently, her hands trembling now. “No, Sarah. I’m sure. I don’t know him. I don’t even know anyone named Abubakar! And Tabeenah—” her voice broke, and she wiped at her tears, “she won’t believe me. She thinks I’ve been lying this whole time, that I’m hiding some kind of relationship.”

Sarah looked down, her own thoughts racing. She wanted to trust Jaisha completely, but doubt lingered in the back of her mind. Who would leave a letter like that? And why?

“Let me talk to Tabeenah,” Sarah said gently. “Maybe I can help smooth things over. She’s just upset right now, and—”

“No,” Jaisha interrupted, her voice shaky but firm. “She won’t listen. She’s already made up her mind. I don’t even know what to say to her anymore. Everything I do, everything I say—it’s like she’s waiting for me to slip up, to prove her right.”

Sarah squeezed Jaisha’s hand, her expression filled with sympathy. “She’ll come around, Jaisha. She’s your sister. She loves you, she just—she doesn’t understand what’s going on. But I’ll try to talk to her, okay?”

Jaisha nodded weakly, wiping at her tears again, but she couldn’t shake the hollow feeling settling in her chest. The bond she once had with Tabeenah felt fragile now like it was crumbling under the weight of doubt and suspicion. And even Sarah, who had always been her rock, seemed unsure.

As Sarah sat beside her, silent and pensive, the door to their hostel room creaked open again. Both girls looked up, expecting to see Tabeenah, but it was another hostel mate, Sana, standing in the doorway.

“There you are,” Sana said, glancing between the two of them. “I overheard some girls talking about Tabeenah storming through the hall. Something about a letter?”

Jaisha’s heart sank further. The rumor had already started to spread. The last thing she needed was more eyes on her, more judgment. She quickly turned away, trying to regain her composure.

Sarah shot Sana a look, and the other girl, sensing the tension, quickly excused herself with a mumbled apology, leaving the room just as swiftly as she had entered.

Jaisha slumped against the wall, her head buried in her hands. “It’s all falling apart, Sarah. I feel like I’m drowning, and no one believes me.”

Sarah wrapped her arms around Jaisha, pulling her into a tight hug. “I believe you, Jaisha. We’ll figure this out. We’ll find out who this Abubakar is and clear everything up. I’m not letting you go through this alone, okay?”

Jaisha nodded, though the tears kept coming. She wanted to believe her friend’s words, wanted to cling to the hope that this nightmare would pass, but Tabeenah’s rejection cut deeper than she had expected. The idea that her own sister thought she was a liar, that she was hiding something so personal—it made Jaisha feel like the ground beneath her was giving way.

“I just wish Tabeenah would talk to me,” Jaisha whispered. “I need her to understand. I need her to believe me.”

Sarah sighed softly. “Give her some time. She’s angry, but it’s because she cares. She’ll come around.”

But Jaisha wasn’t so sure. She wasn’t sure of anything anymore. And as the night wore on, with Sarah staying by her side, the weight of the letter—the weight of Abubakar—pressed down on her like a shadow she couldn’t shake.

Whoever had sent it knew what they were doing, and Jaisha feared that the worst was yet to come.

Jaisha sat at her desk, staring at her phone screen, Abubakar’s name freshly etched into her mind. She had spent the better part of the morning scrolling through university records, trying to trace any link to this mysterious figure. The name didn’t trigger any memories, but there was something chilling about how easily this person had intruded into her life.

Her fingers hovered over the keypad, ready to type in a query when her phone buzzed. She jumped slightly, heart pounding as if Abubakar himself had reached out to her. But it wasn’t him.

Ammi.

The name on the screen made her throat tighten. She hadn’t even thought about her parents in the midst of this chaos. A heavy sigh escaped her as she swiped to answer.

“Assalamualaikum, Ammi,” Jaisha greeted, her voice low and weary.

“Walikumassalam, beta. How are you and Tabeenah? You girls are coming home this weekend, right? It’s been too long.” Ammi’s voice carried its usual warmth, a stark contrast to the storm raging in Jaisha’s mind.

Jaisha swallowed hard, glancing over at Tabeenah’s empty bed. Her sister had left early, avoiding her completely. They hadn’t spoken in days, the tension between them growing thicker by the minute.

“Yes, Ammi. We’ll come,” Jaisha replied, her voice faltering slightly. “It’s been a busy week, but… we’ll be there.”

“Good. Abbu misses you both. He’s been asking about your studies.” There was a brief pause before Ammi added in a softer tone, “Is everything alright, beta? You sound a little… tired.”

Jaisha closed her eyes, pressing her lips together. She wished she could tell her mother everything—that she could collapse into her embrace and let the burden of the last few days fall away. But she knew better. Tabeenah wasn’t speaking to her, and she couldn’t add more fuel to the fire by bringing their family into it.

“I’m fine, Ammi,” she said, forcing a smile into her words. “Just tired from assignments. We’ll be home soon, don’t worry.”

After exchanging a few more pleasantries, Jaisha hung up the phone and let out a long breath. The weight of the weekend loomed over her now, heavy and unavoidable. Going home should have felt like a relief, but instead, it felt like walking into another minefield.

A few minutes later, the door creaked open, and Tabeenah stepped inside, her expression as icy as ever. She moved toward her side of the room without a word, her shoulders tense, as if bracing for a fight that hadn’t even begun.

Jaisha stood, her resolve hardening. This had to stop. She couldn’t let the tension follow them home. If there was one thing she could salvage from this mess, it was their family’s peace.

“Hey,” Jaisha called out softly.

Tabeenah didn’t respond, didn’t even glance in her direction, but Jaisha pressed on. She needed to say this, no matter how much her sister wanted to shut her out.

“Listen, I know you’re upset with me. But whatever’s happened here… it stays here. We’re not telling Ammi or Abbu. They don’t need to know.”

Tabeenah finally looked up, her eyes narrowing. Her lips were pressed into a thin line, and for a moment, Jaisha wondered if she was going to ignore her again. But then Tabeenah’s voice cut through the tension, cold and sharp.

“As if I would tell them,” Tabeenah scoffed. “I’m not going to drag them into your mess.”

Jaisha flinched, the words hitting harder than she expected. “This isn’t my mess, Tabeenah,” she whispered. “I didn’t ask for any of this. I don’t even know who Abubakar is.”

Tabeenah’s jaw clenched, but she remained silent, turning her back to Jaisha as she began packing her things for the weekend trip. The distance between them felt insurmountable, like a wall that had been built brick by brick over the last few days.

“I just need you to believe me,” Jaisha added softly, her voice thick with emotion. “I would never lie to you.”

For a brief second, Tabeenah hesitated, her hand pausing over her bag. But whatever flicker of doubt or empathy had surfaced quickly vanished as she straightened up and walked toward the door.

“I’ll meet you downstairs when you’re ready,” Tabeenah said curtly, her words devoid of warmth, before slipping out of the room without a backward glance.

Jaisha stood frozen in place, her heart sinking deeper. She had thought confronting Abubakar would be her biggest challenge today, but now, facing the cold distance between her and Tabeenah felt like an impossible battle. She wished she could go back to when things were simple—when she and her sister were inseparable, when trust wasn’t something they had to beg for.

With a heavy sigh, Jaisha began packing her own things, her movements slow and deliberate. The weekend at home loomed large in her mind. She wasn’t sure how she’d keep everything from Ammi and Abbu. Their mother was perceptive, always noticing the tiniest details. Hiding the strain between her and Tabeenah would be difficult, but Jaisha had no other choice. She couldn’t afford to let their parents see how broken things had become.

As she zipped up her bag, her phone buzzed again. For a fleeting moment, her heart raced—was it Abubakar? But when she glanced at the screen, it was a message from Sarah.

"Heading home for the weekend too. Will miss our long talks. Hope you’re okay, J. Text me if you need anything."

Jaisha’s fingers hovered over the screen. Sarah had been her rock these past few days, but even she had begun to question Jaisha after seeing that letter. It hurt—more than Jaisha wanted to admit. She felt isolated, misunderstood. Even her best friend had doubts.

Jaisha closed her eyes, her fingers trembling as she typed a simple reply:

"Thanks, Sarah. Talk soon."

She slid the phone into her bag, her heart heavy with uncertainty. As she grabbed her sketchbook and prepared to leave, Jaisha paused, taking one last look at the room that had become a battleground of unspoken words and broken trust. She had hoped to find answers, to confront Abubakar and clear her name, but that confrontation would have to wait.

For now, she had to face her family—and the fractures that had begun to form within it.

With a deep breath, Jaisha swung her bag over her shoulder and headed for the door, the weight of her secret and her sister’s coldness pressing down on her as she left for home.

The steady hum of the bus engine did little to ease the tension between Jaisha and Tabeenah. The road stretched ahead of them, winding like an unspoken promise of home, but the silence inside the bus was deafening. Tabeenah sat by the window, her body turned away, lost in the blur of trees and fields rushing by. Jaisha, on the other hand, clutched her sketchbook tightly in her lap, her fingers trembling against the worn leather cover.

She had tried to break the ice multiple times—small attempts at conversation that were met with cold, curt replies or stony silence. Now, she just stared ahead, replaying the recent days in her mind: the letter, the accusations, the slow erosion of trust between them. She could feel the weight of Tabeenah’s unspoken words, her sister’s coldness hanging in the air like a shroud.

Jaisha closed her eyes, leaning her head back against the seat. “Arham… it wouldn’t be so hard,” she murmured to herself, her voice barely a whisper.

And with those words, the memories rushed back, sharp and vivid like the stroke of a pencil across paper.

It was a breezy afternoon, the kind that made Lahore’s campus feel alive with whispers carried by the wind. Jaisha had been walking aimlessly, her thoughts a jumble of lectures and assignments when she spotted him. Under the shade of a sprawling tree, nestled on the edge of the university lawn, a figure sat cross-legged, sketching with a quiet intensity that caught her attention.

She had seen his work before, hanging in the corridors and galleries of the university—breathtaking, intricate pieces that seemed to capture more than just the physical world. They seemed to hold emotions, frozen in time, and Jaisha had always been drawn to them. But she had never imagined the artist himself would be so unassuming, so human.

Jaisha hesitated for a moment, watching him from a distance. His face was calm, his focus unwavering as his pencil danced across the page, but there was a softness to his expression, a gentleness in the way his hand moved. Something about the scene tugged at her, like an invitation she couldn’t refuse.

Gathering her courage, she stepped forward, her voice cutting through the rustling of the leaves. “Oh... so you’re the artist whose paintings are all around the university?”

The man looked up, his eyes meeting hers with a quiet curiosity. He paused, pencil in mid-air, as if deciding whether to be amused or annoyed by the interruption. But then, a small smile played on his lips—polite, almost shy.

“I suppose I am,” he replied, his voice deep but gentle, like the soft rumble of distant thunder.

Jaisha’s heart quickened slightly. There was something about the way he spoke, the way he carried himself that was both intriguing and comforting. She dropped her bag to the ground and sat beside him, uninvited but not unwelcome. Her eyes drifted to his sketchpad, taking in the strokes, the precision, the life he had breathed onto the paper.

For a few moments, she just watched her gaze following the lines that formed under his hand. It was mesmerizing, watching the way his fingers seemed to know exactly where to go like they were guided by something beyond conscious thought.

“I’ve seen your work,” Jaisha said after a beat, her voice softer now. “It’s beautiful. But more than that… it feels alive.”

Arham glanced at her, raising a brow, but he didn’t speak. Instead, he handed her the sketchpad, as if offering her a glimpse into something sacred. Jaisha took it cautiously, her fingers brushing against the edges of the paper. The image before her was simple—a tree, the same one they sat under, its branches swaying slightly in the wind. Yet, the way Arham had drawn it made it feel as though the tree was part of something larger, something timeless.

She looked up at him, her breath catching slightly. “How do you do it?” she asked, her voice barely more than a whisper. “How do you make something so ordinary feel… extraordinary?”

Arham chuckled softly, shaking his head. “It’s not about what you see, Jaisha. It’s about what you feel. The world is full of small moments. You just have to pay attention to them.”

His words lingered in the air between them, like the beginning of something neither of them could yet name. Jaisha bit her lip, her thoughts racing ahead of her.

“Will you teach me?” she blurted out before she could stop herself, her cheeks flushing with the boldness of the question.

Arham looked at her for a long moment, his gaze searching, as if trying to understand why she was asking. He didn’t answer right away, but Jaisha could see the contemplation in his eyes, the quiet consideration. Finally, he nodded, his smile returning.

“If you’re willing to learn, I’ll teach you,” he said simply, as though it were the most natural thing in the world.

A wave of relief and excitement washed over Jaisha, her heart lifting. She hadn’t expected him to agree so easily, hadn’t expected him to even take her seriously. But here he was, offering her a door into a world she had only dreamed of entering.

Back on the bus, Jaisha’s fingers brushed the edge of her sketchbook, her mind still lost in the memory. That was how it had started—the lessons, the quiet afternoons spent under the same tree, learning from a man who had opened her eyes to a part of herself she hadn’t known existed. Arham had become more than just a teacher. He had become a mirror, reflecting back to her the pieces she had been too afraid to confront.

Her chest tightened at the thought. It had seemed so simple back then, so innocent. But now, everything had unraveled. The trust, the connection, the understanding that had once felt so solid was now as fragile as the paper in her hands.

“It wouldn’t be so hard,” Jaisha whispered again, her voice barely audible as the bus rattled over a bump in the road. “If only…”

She glanced over at Tabeenah, who still sat rigid and cold beside her as if the seat between them was a chasm too wide to cross. Jaisha’s heart ached at the sight. If only she could explain—if only her sister could see that none of this was what it seemed. That the relationship with Arham had never been more than a shared passion for art and understanding. But the accusations, the suspicions, had muddied the truth beyond recognition.

As the bus rumbled on, Jaisha felt the weight of the past pressing down on her, threatening to pull her under. The memory of those early days with Arham—the simplicity, the purity of it—now felt distant, almost like a dream. But one thing remained crystal clear in her mind.

She had to find Abubakar. He was the key to unraveling this web, the key to proving her innocence. But before she could confront him, before she could clear her name, she had to face the storm waiting for them at home.

And Tabeenah, no matter how much she hated her right now, was still her sister. Whatever happened next, they would have to face it together.

For better or worse.

The bus rattled along the uneven road, the low hum of the engine filling the silence between Jaisha and Tabeenah. Tabeenah hadn’t spoken a word since they had boarded, her body turned away as if the landscape outside the window offered more comfort than the sister sitting beside her.

Jaisha, however, was miles away, lost in the swirling fragments of the past.

It had been months since that first encounter with Arham. What started as casual lessons beneath the university tree had evolved into something far more profound. Arham had become her mentor, her guide—showing her the intricacies of not just art but life. Jaisha found herself growing in ways she had never imagined.

He didn’t just teach her how to draw; he taught her how to see.

"You don't just sketch the world as it is," Arham would say, his voice calm, his hands moving across the paper with ease. "You sketch the world as it feels."

The words had resonated with her, lingering in the quiet spaces of her mind long after their lessons had ended. Under his guidance, Jaisha’s sketches began to change. Her lines grew bolder, her strokes more confident. It wasn’t just a skill; it was a transformation.

Yet, along with this transformation came a shift that Jaisha hadn’t expected. The once simple bond between mentor and student grew complex. Arham’s presence, once comforting, began to feel... heavier. There were moments when he would fall silent, his eyes lingering on her work with a strange intensity that made her heart beat faster, though she couldn't tell why.

One afternoon, while they sat under the familiar tree, Arham broke the usual rhythm of their sessions. He put down his pencil and looked at her with a seriousness that made Jaisha’s breath hitch.

“Jaisha,” he said, his voice lower than usual. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you.”

Jaisha looked up from her sketchpad, surprised by the sudden shift in his tone. Arham wasn’t the type to ask personal questions. He had always maintained a respectful distance, never prying into her life beyond the world of art. But now, something in his gaze unsettled her, made her feel like she was standing on the edge of something she couldn’t quite see.

“What is it?” she asked, her voice cautious.

Arham hesitated for a moment, his fingers tapping lightly on the edge of his sketchpad. “Why do you draw?” he finally asked, though his eyes suggested he was asking something far deeper.

Jaisha blinked, confused by the question. “I—because I love it, I guess. It helps me make sense of things.”

He nodded slowly, as though he had expected the answer. But there was something else behind his gaze, something Jaisha couldn’t quite place.

“Do you ever wonder,” he said softly, “if art is the only way to reveal the truth? About who we really are?”

The question struck her like a stone. The weight of it sank into her chest, filling her with a strange unease. There was something in his words that felt... too close. Too personal.

Jaisha opened her mouth to respond, but before she could speak, Arham leaned forward slightly, his voice dropping to a whisper. “You’ve been holding something back. I can see it in your sketches. There’s a part of you that’s afraid to let go.”

The accusation, gentle as it was, hit her like a punch to the gut. She wasn’t sure if it was his words or the quiet intensity in his eyes that unsettled her, but in that moment, Jaisha felt exposed in a way she hadn’t before.

She wanted to deny it, to brush off his words, but a part of her knew he was right. There was something she had been holding back—something she couldn’t name, even if she wanted to. And the more she tried to push it down, the more it fought to rise to the surface.

Jaisha looked away, her throat tight. “I don’t know what you mean,” she whispered, though her voice lacked conviction.

Arham’s eyes softened, his expression turning almost apologetic. “It’s okay,” he said quietly. “You don’t have to understand it yet. But when you’re ready… you’ll see.”

His words lingered in the air between them, heavy and full of meaning that Jaisha couldn’t grasp. It was as if he had reached inside her and touched something fragile, something she had kept hidden even from herself.

The memory hung in Jaisha’s mind like a thick fog, swirling and unrelenting as the bus jolted her back to the present. The university grounds, the tree, Arham’s steady gaze—it all felt so close, yet so far away. She had never fully understood what he had meant back then, but now, in the aftermath of everything that had happened, his words gnawed at her.

What had she been holding back?

The bus hit a bump, and Jaisha blinked, her focus returning to the now. Her hands were clenched tightly in her lap, her fingers white from the pressure. She could feel the weight of Tabeenah’s silence beside her, the unspoken accusations still hanging between them.

Suddenly, Jaisha’s phone buzzed, pulling her from her thoughts. She glanced down, seeing a notification flash briefly on the screen—a message from an unknown number.

But there was no time to open it. The bus had slowed, and their stop was approaching. Jaisha stuffed her phone into her bag hastily, her thoughts already scattered. The familiar sight of their neighborhood came into view, the buildings casting long shadows in the evening light.

They had arrived.

Tabeenah, still refusing to speak, grabbed her bag and stepped off the bus quickly, her movements sharp and deliberate. Jaisha followed her heart heavy and mind racing. The unspoken tension between them only deepened as they hurried toward home, the warmth of family awaiting them.

Whatever that message was, it would have to wait.

Jaisha kept her eyes forward, her pace quickening to match Tabeenah’s. There was no time to dwell on anything else. Right now, they had to step into the familiar roles of daughters returning home for the weekend, and no matter what was simmering between them, their parents couldn’t know. The air around them was thick with secrets, but the moment they crossed the threshold of their home, those secrets would have to be buried—at least for now.

Her phone buzzed again in her bag, but Jaisha ignored it. She couldn’t afford to think about it now.

Who was it from?

But more importantly… what did they want?

Pushing the thought aside, Jaisha let the front door of their house swing open, stepping into the warm, inviting embrace of home, where for just a moment, the past could be forgotten. But deep down, she knew—whatever that message contained, whoever had sent it—it wasn’t going away.

And sooner or later, it would catch up to her.

Faster than she was ready for.

Tabeenah walked ahead, her silence still as sharp as the accusations she had hurled days before. Jaisha trailed behind her, her steps slower, as if the weight of everything that had happened clung to her ankles. As they stepped into the warmth of their home, the familiar scents of Ammi’s cooking filled the air, but the comfort Jaisha usually found in it didn’t reach her today.

Their mother stood in the kitchen, her eyes flicking between the two sisters. She could sense the tension, the quiet storm brewing between them, but like most mothers, she knew when not to press. If they weren’t ready to talk, she wouldn’t force it.

Still, Jaisha noticed the way Ammi’s gaze lingered a little too long on the space between her and Tabeenah, the way her smile didn’t fully reach her eyes. But Jaisha couldn’t handle another confrontation, not today. Not with Tabeenah, not with anyone. She was too tired, too worn out by the secrets that felt like they were crushing her from the inside.

After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Ammi let them be, retreating to her kitchen duties. Jaisha exhaled, relieved, but only for a moment.

As she reached for her phone, her heart stuttered. She had forgotten about the message. The one she’d ignored on the bus. Hands trembling slightly, she unlocked her screen and there it was. A single message from a private number, glaring at her like an accusation.

Why did you leave so fast? I want to play with you. I want to see you.

Jaisha’s entire body went cold. The blood drained from her face, leaving her pale. She felt as if her soul had just left her body, hovering above her, watching in silent panic. Her chest tightened, and for a second, she couldn’t breathe.

No name. No identifier. But she knew. It was him. It had to be Abubakar.

Her mind raced, flashes of the last few weeks playing in her head. How could this be happening? Why hadn’t he left her alone? She had never responded, never encouraged this—so why was this still happening?

The words on the screen seemed to pulse with dark energy, the threat unspoken but unmistakable.

“Jaisha, what happened?” Ammi’s voice cut through the rising panic, pulling her back to the room. Jaisha snapped her phone shut, tucking it into her pocket with a forced smile, but the tension in her face betrayed her.

“Oh, uh…” she stammered, her mind scrambling for an excuse. “It’s just… just something from the university. I forgot about an assignment deadline.”

Ammi raised an eyebrow but didn’t push further. She could tell something was off, but she wasn’t the type to pry unless she thought it was necessary. “Don’t worry, you’ll manage,” she said, giving Jaisha a reassuring smile before turning back to her cooking.

Jaisha forced a nod, her thoughts still scattered, her heart racing. Manage? How could she manage this? She hadn’t told anyone about the letters, about Abubakar, not even Sarah, who had been with her through everything. If Tabeenah found out about this, she would explode. She already thought Jaisha was hiding things—this would be the final nail in the coffin.

And if Ammi or Abbu found out… Jaisha didn’t even want to think about the consequences.

She sat down in the living room, her back to the wall, trying to calm herself. Tabeenah hadn’t spoken a word since they’d entered the house, and the silence between them felt heavier than ever. For once, Jaisha was grateful for it. She didn’t know if she could handle Tabeenah’s suspicion right now, not while this new threat loomed so large.

Her phone buzzed again, and Jaisha’s pulse quickened. She didn’t dare look at it this time. Whatever Abubakar wanted, she wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of a response. Not now, not ever. But the fear was there, gnawing at her from the inside. What if he didn’t stop? What if he escalated? The possibility of her private life being exposed—of more rumors swirling around her name—was too much to bear.

And the worst part was, she had no idea how to make it stop.

Jaisha clutched the phone in her hand, terrified of what might come next but determined not to let it show. She had to stay calm. She had to keep it all hidden, at least for now. No one could know what was happening. Not until she figured out how to deal with it.

She stood up, her movements stiff, and made her way upstairs to her room, her pulse still racing. The air in the house felt thick, suffocating. As she reached her door, she paused for a second, her mind still spiraling.

Then she slipped inside, closing the door behind her, trying to steady her breathing, hoping that somehow, she could keep this nightmare from unraveling completely.

But deep down, she knew this was only the beginning. And no matter how hard she tried to ignore it, the storm was already here.

The next day passed in an unexpected calm. Jaisha had managed to put on a brave face, going through the motions with her family. Tabeenah was still distant, her silence an ever-present weight, but at least they weren’t fighting. Jaisha spent most of the day helping Ammi around the house, their conversation light, filled with laughter that made Jaisha feel almost normal. Almost like everything was okay.

But the calm felt fragile, like the eye of a storm, and Jaisha knew it couldn’t last.

That evening, she sat by the window, watching the sky slowly dim into twilight. Her phone buzzed on the nightstand, but she ignored it at first. She didn’t want to ruin what had been a surprisingly peaceful day. But the buzzing continued, insistent, pulling her out of her thoughts.

Reluctantly, she picked up the phone and unlocked the screen.

A single message awaited her, from that same private number.

Oh... So you’re ignoring me.

Jaisha’s heart sank. The sick feeling that had settled in her stomach the day before returned with full force. She stared at the message, her mind spinning. She had hoped, foolishly perhaps, that Abubakar—or whoever this was—would just stop. That if she didn’t engage, the harassment would end on its own.

But it hadn’t. It was getting worse.

She gripped the phone tighter, her palms sweating. Part of her wanted to respond, to say something, anything, to make it stop. But another part, the part driven by fear, kept her frozen. She didn’t want to make things worse.

Before she could decide what to do, another message arrived.

I think I should talk to your sister… Or maybe your husband. It would be great if he knows how much I love you.

Jaisha’s blood ran cold. She read the message once, then again, her heart pounding in her chest. Husband? What was this person talking about? She wasn’t married—there was no husband to inform. But the mention of Tabeenah sent a wave of terror crashing over her. How did this person know about her family? How did they know so much about her life?

She couldn’t breathe. Her thoughts spiraled in every direction, panic tightening its grip around her throat.

Who was this person?

And what did they really want?

Jaisha’s fingers shook as she typed out a reply, unable to hold back any longer. She had to say something, anything, to make this stop before it spiraled even further out of control.

Who are you? And why are you doing all this? Just stop.

Her thumb hovered over the “send” button for a moment, her heart racing. What if responding only made things worse? But what other choice did she have?

With a deep breath, she hit send.

The message disappeared from her screen, and she immediately regretted it. A knot formed in her stomach as she waited for a reply, each second stretching longer than the last. The fear, the uncertainty—it was suffocating.

What if this person didn’t stop?

What if things only got worse from here?

Jaisha swallowed hard, trying to calm the panic rising in her chest. She couldn’t let this person ruin her life. She couldn’t let them destroy everything she had worked so hard to keep together. But deep down, the fear lingered, growing like a dark cloud that threatened to consume her whole.

There was no escape from this—not yet.

All she could do was wait.

Jaisha barely slept that night. Every creak of the house, every passing car, felt like an ominous sign that something worse was coming. The darkness in her room mirrored the growing dread inside her. She lay on her bed, eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling, clutching her phone as if it were the only tether keeping her connected to the real world.

The minutes dragged into hours, and still, no reply came.

By morning, her body ached from the tension. She dragged herself out of bed, feeling as if the weight of the night had pressed her into the mattress, leaving her too drained to face the day. Yet, she knew she had to. She had to keep pretending everything was normal, that nothing was unraveling beneath the surface.

Downstairs, Tabeenah and Ammi were already in the kitchen, talking quietly over breakfast. The familiar smell of parathas filled the air, but Jaisha’s stomach churned at the thought of eating. Her eyes briefly met Tabeenah’s, but the coldness remained, an invisible wall between them that neither had tried to cross since the last confrontation.

Ammi, ever perceptive, glanced between them. She knew something was off but said nothing. Instead, she handed Jaisha a cup of tea and smiled softly. "You look tired, beta. Didn’t sleep well?"

Jaisha forced a smile, her hands trembling slightly as she took the cup. “Yeah, just had trouble falling asleep.”

“Is something wrong?” Ammi asked, a hint of concern creeping into her voice.

Jaisha quickly shook her head. “No, no. Just... thinking about school stuff.”

The lie slipped out effortlessly, but inside, Jaisha’s nerves were screaming. Her eyes flickered to Tabeenah, who remained stone-faced, pretending not to care. Tabeenah’s distance gnawed at her, but the fear of the unknown number weighed heavier.

The phone in Jaisha’s pocket felt like a ticking bomb. Each vibration, each moment she reached for it, expecting to see another message from the unknown number, made her heart race. But there was nothing. Only silence.

By the time the afternoon sun had begun to cast long shadows over the house, Jaisha’s anxiety had twisted itself into a knot that refused to untangle. She excused herself from the family and retreated upstairs to her room, needing the quiet space to think, and to breathe.

She took out her phone, opened the messages, and reread the last one.

I think I should talk to your sister… Or maybe your husband. It would be great if he knew how much I love you.

Her chest tightened as the words sank in again. She knew it was Abubakar, even though there was no name attached to the message. He had somehow found a way to worm himself into her life, even from a distance. The thought of him knowing about her family, about her life—about Tabeenah—was unbearable.

Jaisha’s hands shook as she typed out another message, but her thoughts were jumbled, her fear making it hard to focus. She deleted her words, then typed them out again, each time growing more frustrated. Her mind was spinning, spiraling into a darkness that she couldn’t claw her way out of.

Before she could settle on what to say, her phone buzzed again. The same private number.

Her heart lurched.

Do you think ignoring me will help? You should know better, Jaisha. We have so much left to talk about.

Jaisha’s pulse quickened as she read the message, her entire body trembling. She was trapped. If she continued to ignore him, he might make good on his threat to involve Tabeenah. But if she replied, who knew what doors it would open?

She felt suffocated by the sheer weight of the decision.

Suddenly, there was a knock on her door. Jaisha jumped, her heart leaping into her throat. “Jaisha?” It was Ammi’s voice, soft but filled with motherly concern. “You’ve been in there a while, beta. Everything alright?”

Jaisha swallowed hard, her eyes darting to the phone in her hand. She quickly shoved it under her pillow. “I’m fine, Ammi. I’ll be down in a minute.”

There was a pause, then Ammi’s voice softened further. “You know, whatever’s bothering you, you can always talk to me. You don’t have to hold it all inside.”

The kindness in her mother’s words sent a sharp pang of guilt through Jaisha’s chest. She wanted nothing more than to tell her, to spill everything and feel the weight lift off her shoulders. But how could she? This wasn’t something she could involve her family in. Not yet.

“I will, Ammi. I promise.”

Ammi’s footsteps faded down the hallway, and Jaisha sat back against the wall, feeling the weight of the world pressing down on her. The tension between her and Tabeenah was unbearable, her mother’s concern hurt even more, and the silent threat of Abubakar was suffocating her completely.

She pulled the phone back out and opened the message thread again. Her fingers hovered over the screen.

This couldn’t go on forever. She had to find a way out, some way to stop him before he destroyed everything.

But right now, she was paralyzed by fear, and the more she thought about it, the clearer it became.

Abubakar wasn’t going to stop until he got what he wanted.

And Jaisha wasn’t sure if she could handle what that meant.

Jaisha had barely spoken to anyone all day. She stayed in her room, her thoughts a tangled mess as the threat from the private number hung over her like a dark cloud. The silence of the house, usually comforting, now felt oppressive. She could sense Tabeenah’s tension, the thick wall between them still standing strong. And Ammi’s worried glances weren’t helping either.

As the evening rolled in, Jaisha received another message.

“You know what, Jaisha? I’m done waiting. If you don’t talk to me, maybe your sister will. Let’s see how much she loves hearing about Arham… and you.”

The words struck her like a punch to the gut. A cold wave of fear swept through her as she read the message over and over, trying to make sense of it. This wasn’t just a threat anymore—it was action.

Before she could even think of a response, she heard voices downstairs. Tabeenah’s voice was louder than usual. There was an unmistakable sharpness in it, like something had snapped. Jaisha’s heart began to race as she strained to listen, catching snippets of what was being said.

Then, she heard footsteps pounding up the stairs. They were fast and determined.

Her bedroom door burst open.

Tabeenah stood there, her face twisted in fury, her eyes blazing with a rage Jaisha had never seen before. In her hand was her phone, and Jaisha knew immediately that Abubakar had made good on his threat.

“What did you do?” Tabeenah’s voice was dangerously low, her fists clenched at her sides.

Jaisha opened her mouth to speak, to explain, but before she could say a word, Tabeenah’s hand swung through the air, and the sound of the slap echoed through the room like thunder. Jaisha’s head snapped to the side from the force, her cheek stinging with the heat of the blow.

For a moment, everything was silent.

Tabeenah was shaking with fury, her chest rising and falling with heavy breaths. “You… you lied to me. You’ve been lying this whole time!”

“Tabeenah, I—”

“Shut up!” Tabeenah cut her off, her voice cracking with emotion. “All this time, I thought something was wrong, but you kept hiding things! Arham? Abubakar? What the hell is happening with you?”

Jaisha’s eyes welled up with tears. “It’s not what you think—”

Tabeenah’s face contorted in disbelief. “Not what I think? Do you even know what he said to me?” She threw her phone onto the bed. “He told me everything, Jaisha. He told me how you’ve been leading him on, how you’ve been playing games with him, with Arham. How you’ve been lying to me about all of it!”

Jaisha’s breath caught in her throat. Her head spun with confusion. “No, Tabeenah, that’s not true. I don’t even know Abubakar like that, I swear.”

But Tabeenah wasn’t listening. Her anger had reached its boiling point, and the accusations spilled out like poison. “You lied to me! To me—your own sister! How could you do this? How could you drag our family into this mess?”

Jaisha was trembling, the weight of the situation crashing down on her. “Please, Tabeenah… you have to believe me. I didn’t know any of this would happen. Abubakar—he’s trying to ruin everything, but I never—”

Before Jaisha could finish, she heard the one voice she had been dreading.

“What’s going on here?”

Ammi stood at the doorway, her face etched with concern, confusion, and the quiet authority of a mother who had just walked into a storm.

For a brief moment, Tabeenah’s rage faltered. She looked at Jaisha, and then at their mother, and her shoulders sagged as if all the anger had drained out of her at once. Tears welled in her eyes as she spoke, her voice now trembling with the weight of the secret she was about to reveal.

“Ammi, she’s been hiding things from us… about Arham… and someone named Abubakar.”

Jaisha felt her world tilt as Tabeenah’s words sliced through the air like a blade. The one thing she had tried so hard to keep from their family, the secret she had desperately wanted to handle on her own, was now laid bare in front of her mother. The ground seemed to shift beneath her feet.

Ammi’s face paled, and she took a step forward, her voice soft but firm. “What is this about, Jaisha? Who is Abubakar? And what does Arham have to do with this?”

Jaisha couldn’t speak. She stood there, frozen, her mind racing, searching for the right words to explain everything. But nothing came. Only the crushing silence, and the knowledge that her mother’s gaze, filled with confusion and hurt, was fixed on her.

“I trusted you, Jaisha,” Tabeenah whispered, her voice breaking. “I thought I could help you… I thought I could protect you from whatever was happening. But you never let me in.”

Jaisha’s tears finally spilled over as she looked at her sister, feeling the full weight of her betrayal.

“This is not what you think,” Jaisha managed to choke out. “Whatever this person told you was a lie. Ammi and you know about Arham. I am not lying. I did not do anything wrong.”

But it was too late. The damage had been done. Tabeenah’s anger had torn open the very thing Jaisha had tried so hard to keep together. And now, with Ammi standing there, waiting for an explanation, Jaisha felt as if her entire world was crumbling beneath her feet.

The phone buzzed again, an unwelcome reminder that Abubakar’s presence still loomed over them like a shadow. But this time, Jaisha couldn’t bring herself to look. The damage was already done.

Ammi stepped further into the room, her voice soft but filled with a mother’s unmistakable worry. “Jaisha… you need to tell us everything. No more secrets.”

Jaisha wiped her eyes, her throat tight with fear. She could hear her heart pounding in her ears, drowning out everything else. She had no choice now. The truth, no matter how messy or painful, had to come out.

But even as she opened her mouth to speak, she couldn’t shake the feeling that the worst was yet to come.

The air in the room was so thick with tension that Jaisha could barely breathe. Her vision blurred, the room spinning around her as the weight of her sister's anger and her mother's confusion pressed in from all sides. Her heart pounded in her chest, each beat echoing like a drum in her ears. The words she needed to say were stuck in her throat, tangled in a web of fear and desperation.

Ammi's voice, soft yet commanding, broke the heavy silence. "Jaisha... talk to us. No more hiding. We can fix this, but we need to know the truth."

Jaisha's lips parted to respond, but the world around her tilted violently. The tension, the accusations, the constant fear of Abubakar's messages—it all swirled together into a suffocating storm. Her breath caught in her throat, and before she could register what was happening, the edges of her vision darkened.

Her knees buckled.

"Jaisha!" Ammi's panicked voice was the last thing she heard before everything went black.

When Jaisha woke up, she was lying on the couch in the living room. A soft breeze floated in through the open window, carrying the familiar scent of jasmine that usually calmed her, but now only reminded her of the storm she had left behind upstairs. She blinked, trying to shake off the fog clouding her mind.

"You're awake," Ammi said gently, sitting beside her. Tabeenah stood in the doorway, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, her face still a mask of anger and hurt.

Jaisha sat up slowly, feeling the weight of the situation settle back on her shoulders. She could see the worry etched into Ammi's face, the tension in the room still palpable, though muted now by concern.

"You fainted," Ammi said, brushing a strand of hair away from Jaisha's face. "We were worried."

"I... I'm sorry," Jaisha whispered, her throat dry. She looked down at her hands, unable to meet either of their eyes. How could she explain what she didn't even fully understand herself?

Ammi reached out and took Jaisha's hand in hers. "Beta, whatever is happening, we will get through it. But you need to tell us everything. Who is this Abubakar? Why is he sending these messages?"

Jaisha felt a lump form in her throat as she thought about the messages, about how far things had spiraled out of control. She had tried so hard to handle it on her own, to protect her family from the mess Abubakar had created, but now it had bled into their lives. She had no choice but to be honest.

With a deep breath, Jaisha finally began to speak.

"I don't know who Abubakar is," she started, her voice shaky but growing stronger with each word. "At first, I thought it was just a misunderstanding. He sent me a message one day, and I ignored it, thinking it was someone playing a prank. But then the messages kept coming... and they got worse."

She paused, glancing briefly at Tabeenah, who remained silent but was clearly listening.

"At first, I thought it had something to do with Arham," Jaisha continued, her heart aching as she spoke his name. "But then Abubakar started threatening me, saying he'd talk to Tabeenah, that he'd tell you lies about me. I didn't want you to get dragged into this, so I tried to deal with it on my own."

Tabeenah's expression softened slightly, but she didn't say anything.

"I never led him on," Jaisha said, her voice pleading. "I don't even know how he found out about Arham. All I know is that he's been trying to ruin everything, and I was scared... so scared that if I said something, it would only make things worse."

Ammi let out a long breath, her hand tightening around Jaisha's. "Beta, you should have told us sooner. We could have helped you."

"I know," Jaisha whispered, tears filling her eyes. "But I thought I could fix it. I thought if I stayed quiet, it would go away."

Tabeenah uncrossed her arms, her face a mix of confusion and regret. "Why didn't you trust me, Jaisha? I would have helped you... I thought we were closer than this."

"I didn't want you to hate me," Jaisha admitted, her voice cracking. "I knew how much you looked up to me, and I didn't want to disappoint you."

Tabeenah’s anger seemed to wane, replaced by a deep sadness. She sighed, rubbing her forehead as if trying to erase the hurt. "I don’t hate you," she said quietly. "But this... this whole thing... it’s too much, Jaisha. I don't understand why you'd hide something so serious from me."

Jaisha wiped her eyes. "I didn’t want to make things worse between us. I thought if I kept it quiet, I could protect you from all of this. I’m sorry, Tabeenah. I’m so sorry."

There was a long pause, the room filled only with the sound of the wind rustling the curtains. Then, finally, Tabeenah walked over and sat beside Jaisha on the couch. She didn’t say anything, but the simple act of sitting there was enough. Jaisha knew that, at least for now, her sister was trying to understand.

"We’ll figure this out," Ammi said, her voice firm but gentle. "But no more secrets, Jaisha. If something like this ever happens again, you come to us. Do you understand?"

Jaisha nodded, her heart heavy but lighter than it had been in days. For the first time, she felt like she wasn’t carrying the burden alone.

As they sat there in the quiet of their home, Jaisha’s phone buzzed again. Her body tensed, fear spiking through her like lightning. She looked at the phone in her lap, not wanting to pick it up but knowing she had to.

She glanced at Ammi and Tabeenah, both watching her closely.

With shaking hands, she unlocked the phone and opened the message.

“You think telling your family will protect you? Think again. This is just the beginning.”

Jaisha’s blood ran cold, but this time, she wasn’t alone. She handed the phone to Ammi, her fingers trembling.

Ammi looked at the message, her face hardening with determination. "This ends now," she said, her voice filled with a quiet strength that made Jaisha feel, for the first time in a long while, that things might actually be okay.

Tabeenah placed a hand on Jaisha’s shoulder, her touch reassuring. "We’ll handle this together," she said, her voice soft but sincere.

For the first time in days, Jaisha felt a small flicker of hope. It wasn’t over, not by a long shot—but at least now, she wasn’t fighting this battle alone.

The next morning was quiet. The usual hustle and bustle of the house seemed dulled as if the tension from the day before had pressed a weight upon everything. Jaisha had barely slept. Her mind raced with thoughts of the messages, of Abubakar’s threats, and the dread that lingered in the air between her and Tabeenah. Though they had spoken, a part of her still felt unsettled, fragile, like the calm before a storm.

As she sat at the kitchen table, absently stirring her tea, the sound of the doorbell jolted her from her thoughts. Her heart leaped into her throat. Could it be another message, another escalation from Abubakar? Was he now sending things to her home?

Ammi appeared in the hallway, wiping her hands on a dish towel as she went to answer the door. Jaisha’s palms grew sweaty, her stomach twisting into knots. She stood up slowly, inching closer to the doorway as if preparing herself for whatever nightmare awaited her on the other side.

But when the door opened, it was just the postman standing there, holding a large bouquet of flowers and a small, carefully wrapped package. His cheerful demeanor seemed to clash against the oppressive atmosphere that had settled over the house.

“For Mrs. Jaisha,” the postman announced with a smile, glancing down at his clipboard before handing over the delivery.

Ammi’s eyebrows raised in surprise. “Jaisha, there’s something for you.”

Jaisha’s pulse quickened. She hesitated, her eyes fixated on the bouquet as though it might explode at any moment. Her breath hitched as she stepped forward, taking the flowers from her mother’s hands. The vibrant colors and sweet scent of the roses did little to calm her nerves.

"Who would send me flowers?" she thought, fear tightening in her chest. Her mind immediately went to the worst possibility—Abubakar. Was this another twisted game of his?

With trembling hands, Jaisha searched for a card. She found it nestled among the blooms, a small white envelope. Her heart pounded as she opened it, half-expecting some cryptic message designed to unnerve her.

But the words inside weren’t from Abubakar.

They were from her husband.

“A flower for my sweet wife,” the note read in his familiar handwriting. “And a painting from your teacher Arham, specially painted for you. I know things must be difficult right now, but remember, I’m always with you, no matter how far I am. Things will get better soon. Love, your husband.”

A wave of relief washed over her so intensely that her legs nearly buckled. She let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. It wasn’t from Abubakar. It wasn’t a threat. It was love, pure and simple, from the one person who always knew how to make her feel safe, even from across oceans.

Jaisha opened the small, carefully wrapped package. Inside was a painting—Arham’s painting. Her breath caught as she held it in her hands, gazing at the image. It was a scene she recognized: the very tree where they had spent countless hours sketching together. But the painting wasn’t just a replica of that place; it had layers, depth, and hidden meaning.

The branches of the tree twisted slightly as if bending under some unseen force, but they didn’t break. Instead, they reached toward the light, a faint, warm glow in the background. The sky above was a gradient of dusk, caught between night and day, symbolizing uncertainty. But the light was there, guiding the way forward.

Arham had always been a master of subtlety, of painting emotions rather than just scenes. This painting told a story—a story of hope, of resilience in the face of struggle. It was as if Arham was trying to tell her that no matter how hard things seemed, they would get better. The storm would pass, and the light would remain.

Tears pricked Jaisha’s eyes. The timing of the gift, and the thoughtfulness of both her husband and Arham, was more than she could handle in that moment. Her heart ached with the weight of it all—the chaos of the past few days, the guilt, the fear, and now, this gentle reminder that she wasn’t alone.

Ammi, who had been watching Jaisha’s reaction carefully, stepped forward. “Jaisha, what is it?” she asked softly, sensing the shift in her daughter’s mood.

Jaisha smiled weakly, brushing a tear from her cheek. “It’s from my husband… and Arham.” She showed her the card and the painting. “He sent these to remind me that things will get better.”

Ammi’s eyes softened as she looked at the painting. “It’s beautiful. You’re lucky to have people in your life who care so much for you, Jaisha. Your husband… and Arham.” She said Arham’s name with the same understanding Jaisha had always felt from her mother—gentle, without judgment.

But Jaisha couldn’t ignore the tightness in her chest. The painting was a gift of hope, yet the looming presence of Abubakar cast a shadow over it. What if this was just the calm before the next wave of chaos? She glanced back at the bouquet, then at her phone, half-expecting another message to pop up and ruin the moment.

Instead, she allowed herself a moment of peace. A brief reprieve from the storm. She could worry later, and could plan her next steps when the time came. For now, she needed this reminder. This assurance that no matter how hard things seemed, there was still beauty in the world, still light in the darkness.

“Things will get better,” she whispered to herself, repeating the words like a mantra as she held the painting close.

But deep down, as she placed the gift on her desk, she knew the fight wasn’t over. Not yet.

And somewhere, in the back of her mind, a lingering fear remained: Abubakar wasn’t done with her. Not by a long shot.

But for now, she would hold on to the promise of the painting, to the love from across the seas, and to the hope that she could withstand whatever came next.

The bus ride back to the hostel felt longer than usual. The sky outside had turned a deep indigo, stars beginning to twinkle faintly in the distance. Jaisha stared out of the window, watching the passing trees and the flickering streetlights, her thoughts far away.

Tabeenah sat beside her, silent as ever, her body stiff and cold with unspoken tension. The air between them was thick and heavy with unresolved emotions and fractured trust. Their mother had sensed something was wrong before they left home, but she hadn’t pressed. Instead, she had given them both quiet, watchful glances, letting them leave without forcing a confrontation.

Jaisha felt the weight of those glances even now, as the bus rumbled forward into the night. Her mother’s kindness had made her feel worse, knowing that more secrets were being buried under her own silence.

Tabeenah hadn’t spoken to her since the day of the slap. Though they had exchanged small, necessary words in front of Ammi—polite, cold—nothing had been resolved. The wound was still fresh, raw beneath the surface. And the constant messages from the private number were like salt rubbing into it.

Jaisha shifted uncomfortably in her seat, her mind still spinning from the bouquet and the painting. The gift from her husband had given her a moment of solace, a fragile moment of peace in the storm. But now, sitting in the darkened bus, the unease had returned.

Abubakar was still out there.

Her phone had stayed silent since they’d left home, but she knew it was only a matter of time. Whoever this person was, they weren’t going to let her be. And now, the stakes felt higher. If Tabeenah had already snapped once, what would have happened if Abubakar dragged them even further into his twisted game? The mere thought of what he could do made her chest tighten with fear.

As the bus slowed, pulling into the familiar campus, the tension between the sisters seemed to thicken. The hostel’s silhouette loomed ahead, dark and quiet under the night sky. Tabeenah shifted in her seat, her hands gripping the straps of her bag tightly as if she, too, were bracing for something she wasn’t ready to face.

Without a word, they gathered their things and stepped off the bus. The cool night air wrapped around them, but instead of feeling refreshing, it felt suffocating to Jaisha. The hostel building, usually a place of routine and predictability, now felt like a cage—an isolated island where her troubles were about to deepen.

They walked through the gates, their footsteps echoing in the stillness. Tabeenah remained a few paces ahead, never looking back at Jaisha. The quiet between them spoke louder than any words ever could. It was a silence born not just of anger but of distrust, and Jaisha could feel it growing larger with each step they took.

When they reached their room, Tabeenah tossed her bag onto her bed without so much as a glance in Jaisha’s direction. Her movements were stiff, and controlled, as though she was holding something back. Without a word, she pulled out her phone and sat on the edge of her bed, her back turned to Jaisha.

Jaisha, exhausted and emotionally drained, sat on her own bed, staring at the wall in front of her. The coolness of the hostel room offered no comfort. It was late, but sleep felt impossible. The weight of everything that had happened clung to her like a shadow that wouldn’t let go.

She reached for her phone, hesitating for a moment. The screen was blank. No messages. No threats. Not yet, at least. But she knew it was only a matter of time before the private number would strike again. The thought made her stomach churn with anxiety.

Jaisha had been running from this long enough. She couldn’t keep hiding, couldn’t keep letting fear control her. The painting from Arham, the words of reassurance from her husband—they had reminded her of her strength, of the fight that still burned within her. And she knew now that the only way to truly stop this nightmare was to confront it head-on.

Abubakar had made her life miserable, tearing apart the fragile bonds she had tried so hard to protect. But he had also made one critical mistake: he had underestimated her. She wasn’t just a victim in this game. She wasn’t going to let him hold all the power anymore.

Jaisha clenched her fists, feeling the fire in her chest burn brighter. She would find Abubakar. She would confront him, face whatever twisted lies he had been feeding, and put an end to this once and for all.

It wouldn’t be easy. She knew that. There were still so many unknowns—who was he? How did he know so much about her? Why had he chosen to target her of all people? But these questions only fueled her determination. She would get answers.

One way or another.

Jaisha took a deep breath and glanced toward Tabeenah, whose back was still turned, the silence between them like a yawning chasm. She couldn’t fix everything with her sister yet. But she could at least take control of this one part of her life.

As the night stretched on and the hostel settled into a quiet slumber, Jaisha made a vow to herself.

This time, she wouldn’t run.

She would find Abubakar.

And she would make sure he never threatened her—or her family—again.

Jaisha sat in the middle of the lecture hall, her notebook open but untouched. The professor’s voice droned on, echoing in the vast room filled with students, but none of it registered in her mind. Her thoughts were elsewhere, as they had been for days now, preoccupied with the constant messages from the private number.

She had tried to focus on her psychology notes, scribbling down half-hearted sentences, but every word seemed to blur into nothing. The weight of the threat, the tension with Tabeenah, and the fear of what could happen next—it all felt like a ticking time bomb.

The room was quiet, save for the professor’s voice and the soft scratching of pens and pencils on paper. Jaisha’s phone, tucked away in her bag, buzzed quietly. The subtle vibration sent a jolt through her, her heart immediately racing. She didn’t even need to check it to know.

It was him. Abubakar.

Her fingers trembled as she reached for her phone, pulling it out and unlocking the screen. The message appeared instantly, staring back at her like a silent taunt.

“I’m watching you, Jaisha. You look so distracted today. What’s on your mind?”

Her breath hitched, and her eyes darted around the room. Someone was watching her—right now. She knew it. Her skin prickled with unease as she scanned the faces of her classmates, trying to spot anyone suspicious. The lecture hall was full, but everyone seemed engrossed in their work, heads down, writing notes, or listening to the professor. Nothing stood out.

Her heart raced as the realization hit her. Abubakar was here, in this room. But how could that be? There was no one named Abubakar in her class, she was sure of it. She had gone over the names in her head so many times before, but the answer never came. Was he hiding behind a different name? Could someone she knew be using an alias?

Her palms grew sweaty, and she struggled to keep her composure, feeling like the walls were closing in on her. Was it someone she had trusted all along? Was Abubakar someone she spoke to every day?

Another message buzzed in as if to hammer in the point.

“Don’t worry, you’ll find out soon enough. But it’s more fun this way, isn’t it?”

Jaisha’s throat tightened. She wanted to scream, to call out to everyone in the room, demand who was doing this. Instead, she shoved her phone back into her bag and stared straight ahead, trying to calm the storm inside her.

The rest of the lecture passed in a haze. She didn’t take a single note, barely hearing a word of what the professor said. Her mind was too busy running through every possibility, every person who could be behind this.

By the time class ended, Jaisha felt like she could barely breathe. She walked quickly out of the lecture hall, trying to avoid eye contact with anyone. Someone from her class was Abubakar. But who?

Later that night, back in the hostel, the weight of everything crashed down on her. She sat on her bed, staring at the ceiling, the phone still burning in her pocket. Every message from the private number was like a punch to her gut. How could someone in her class be tormenting her like this? How could someone she shared space with every day be behind this nightmare?

Suddenly, an idea sparked in her mind. Sara.

Sara had always been her closest friend, someone she could trust when things went wrong. And Jaisha remembered something Sara had mentioned months ago, something she hadn’t thought about in the chaos of everything happening.

Sara’s older sister was a tech wizard. A hacker, really. She worked in cybersecurity and had a way of breaking into phones and networks in ways Jaisha barely understood. If anyone could help her track down Abubakar’s real identity, it was her.

With a new surge of determination, Jaisha grabbed her phone and texted Sara.

“Can we talk? I need your help.”

A few minutes later, Sara knocked on the door and stepped inside, concern etched on her face. Jaisha explained everything, from the messages she had been receiving to her suspicions about someone in their class being Abubakar. She felt a wave of relief as Sara listened without judgment, her expression shifting from worry to grim understanding.

Sara thought for a moment before nodding slowly. “You’re right. If this person is in our class, we can find out. My sister has a way of getting into phone systems, retrieving messages—even if they’re from private numbers.”

Jaisha’s heart leapt. “So, she can help?”

“I’ll ask her tonight,” Sara said, her tone serious. “She doesn’t normally do this kind of thing, but for you? She’ll do it. We’ll compare everyone’s phone data with the messages you’ve been getting. If Abubakar is someone we know, we’ll catch him.”

Jaisha felt a flicker of hope for the first time in days. “Thank you, Sara. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”

Sara gave her a reassuring smile. “We’ll figure this out. No one’s going to keep messing with you.”

Later that night, Sara texted her again.

“She agreed.”

Jaisha stared at her phone, her pulse racing. They were finally getting somewhere. This was her chance to unmask Abubakar once and for all.

But as she lay in bed, her mind buzzing with a mix of fear and anticipation, she couldn’t shake the feeling that things were about to get even more dangerous.

Whoever Abubakar was, he wouldn’t go down without a fight.

And Jaisha had no idea just how deep this twisted game was about to go.

The anticipation was unbearable. Jaisha sat in her room, her phone clutched tightly in her hands. Sara had just left after spending hours with her, walking through every detail of how her sister would pull off this feat. Jaisha couldn’t stop her heart from racing—this was it. After all the terror, the sleepless nights, and the suffocating fear, she was finally about to find out who Abubakar really was.

The plan had been simple: Sara’s sister would gain access to the phone networks and retrieve the data from the private number, identifying it by matching the incoming messages to the encrypted phone records. It was risky and dangerous, but Jaisha was desperate. Sara had reassured her that her sister knew what she was doing, and now Jaisha just had to wait.

Hours passed, each one feeling like an eternity. Every time her phone buzzed with a notification, her heart leapt, expecting the answer.

Then, finally, Sara texted.

“Got it. Sending you the details now.”

Jaisha’s hands shook as she opened the message, her eyes scanning the screen for the number she had been haunted by for weeks.

+92* *****.

For a moment, the number didn’t register. It was just a string of digits, nothing more. But then the memory hit her like a tidal wave. She had seen that number before—on a class group chat, on shared projects, on casual WhatsApp conversations. The pieces started to click together in her mind.

This wasn’t Abubakar’s number at all. It was someone else entirely.

Qasim.

Jaisha’s breath caught in her throat, and she dropped her phone, her mind spinning. Qasim—the quiet guy from her class. He wasn’t someone she interacted with much, but she remembered him. He always sat near the back of the lecture hall, usually keeping to himself, though sometimes he would glance at her when he thought no one was looking.

Her mind raced back to their brief encounters. They had shared a few assignments and discussions over the semester, but nothing out of the ordinary. He had always seemed... normal. A little reserved, but harmless.

But the more she thought about it, the more things began to click into place. He was always around—sitting quietly in the background. Observing. Listening. He had never seemed threatening, but there had always been something off. Something she couldn’t quite put her finger on before.

Jaisha’s chest tightened with dread as the truth settled in. Qasim was Abubakar.

But why?

The question gnawed at her, twisting her stomach into knots. Why would Qasim go to such lengths to terrorize her? What did he want? And more importantly, why had he used the name Abubakar?

Her phone buzzed again. It was Sara.

“You okay?”

Jaisha didn’t know how to respond. She felt like the ground had been pulled out from under her, like she had been living in a false reality. She typed a quick reply, her fingers trembling.

“It’s Qasim. I... I don’t understand.”

Sara replied almost immediately.

“Qasim? Are you sure? I thought he was just... you know, a regular guy.”

Jaisha closed her eyes, trying to steady her breathing. Nothing about this made sense. Qasim had always blended into the background—someone you didn’t really notice unless you were looking for him. But now, knowing he was behind the messages, every look he had given her, every small interaction they had shared, took on a new, sinister meaning.

Why me?

The thought echoed in her mind over and over. She needed answers.

But as the pieces began to fit together, Jaisha felt a rising sense of dread. What if Qasim had been watching her all along? What if everything—the messages, the threats, the lies about Abubakar—was all part of some twisted game he had been playing?

She had to confront him. She couldn’t live in fear any longer.

Jaisha stared at her phone, the weight of everything pressing down on her. Qasim had been in her class the entire time, hiding in plain sight. The realization hit her hard—he had been manipulating her, controlling her from the shadows, all while pretending to be someone else. He had made her believe that some mysterious person named Abubakar was after her, but all along, it had been him.

The rage and fear swirled in her chest. She couldn’t sit here and let him continue playing with her life. But how could she approach him without making things worse? She needed a plan. She needed to be smart about this.

Jaisha stood up from her bed and paced the room, trying to calm herself. She needed to think clearly. She couldn’t let her emotions take over now. If she was going to confront Qasim, she had to be ready. She had to be strong.

Her phone buzzed again, pulling her out of her thoughts.

It was another message from Sara.

“My sister says we can get more info if we need it. We can find out where the messages were sent from and even when. Let me know if you want to take this further.”

Jaisha’s mind raced. More information? She wasn’t sure how much more she could handle. But then again, maybe the key to confronting Qasim lay in the details. She needed every bit of leverage she could get.

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, her decision still hanging in the balance.

And then, suddenly, the door to her room creaked open. Jaisha looked up to see Tabeenah standing there, her face pale but determined.

“We need to talk,” Tabeenah said quietly, stepping into the room.

Jaisha’s heart skipped a beat. She nodded, bracing herself for what was to come. But even as she prepared to tell her sister everything, she couldn’t shake the growing fear gnawing at the edges of her mind.

What if Qasim was watching them right now?

Jaisha sat on the edge of her bed, her pulse quickening as Tabeenah stood in the doorway, her expression unreadable. The tension between them had been unbearable for days, and now it felt like everything was teetering on the edge of something huge. Jaisha knew she had to clear the air before anything else—before the situation spiraled even further out of control.

Tabeenah’s eyes scanned the room before they landed on Jaisha’s face. For a moment, neither of them spoke. The weight of the unspoken words between them was suffocating.

Finally, Jaisha broke the silence. “Tabeenah... we need to talk. I need to explain everything.”

Tabeenah’s lips tightened, and she crossed her arms, clearly still guarded. “Explain what, Jaisha? Explain why you lied to me. Why do you drag me into this whole mess without telling me the truth?”

The frustration in her voice stung, but Jaisha could also hear the hurt buried underneath it. She knew this conversation was long overdue, and if she didn’t handle it right now, she might lose her sister for good.

“Tabeenah, I didn’t lie to you. I swear,” Jaisha began, her voice trembling. “There’s so much that I’ve been trying to figure out myself. This person—this Abubakar—he isn’t who we thought he was.”

Tabeenah raised an eyebrow, her gaze narrowing. “What do you mean?”

Jaisha took a deep breath, steadying herself. She couldn’t rush this. “The messages I’ve been getting… they weren’t from Abubakar at all. I thought it was someone I didn’t know, but today—today I found out who’s really behind all of it.”

Tabeenah’s brow furrowed, the anger beginning to give way to confusion. “What are you talking about? Who?”

“It’s Qasim,” Jaisha said, her voice barely above a whisper. “You know, the guy from my class. He’s the one who’s been pretending to be Abubakar. He’s been sending me all these messages, threatening me, manipulating everything.”

Tabeenah blinked in disbelief. “Qasim? That quiet guy from your class? Are you sure?”

“I’m positive,” Jaisha nodded, swallowing the lump in her throat. “Sara’s sister helped me figure it out. She traced the messages back to his phone number. The name Abubakar is just something he used to scare me. To make me think it was someone else.”

For a moment, Tabeenah just stared at her, processing the information. The anger in her expression softened, replaced with something closer to shock and concern.

Jaisha continued, her voice steady but filled with emotion. “I didn’t know what was happening, Tabeenah. At first, I thought maybe I was just overthinking everything, but then things got worse. He started sending these messages, and I didn’t know who to trust. I didn’t want to involve you until I could figure out who was behind it. I didn’t mean to hide it from you. I was just... scared.”

Tabeenah’s arms slowly uncrossed, and she sat down on the edge of the bed next to Jaisha. The coldness between them seemed to thaw, replaced by a quiet understanding.

“Why didn’t you just tell me?” Tabeenah’s voice softened, her eyes filled with concern. “I could’ve helped you, Jaisha. You shouldn’t have had to go through all of this alone.”

Jaisha’s eyes filled with tears, and she shook her head. “I didn’t want to make it worse. I didn’t know what Qasim was capable of, and I was afraid that if you knew, he’d drag you into it, too. I thought I could handle it, but... I was wrong. I needed you, Tabeenah. I needed my sister, but I was too scared to admit it.”

Tabeenah sighed deeply, her shoulders slumping as the weight of everything seemed to crash down on her. “I’m sorry, Jaisha. I shouldn’t have jumped to conclusions. I was angry, but... I should’ve trusted you.”

Jaisha reached out and squeezed Tabeenah’s hand, the bond between them feeling stronger than it had in weeks. “We’ll figure this out together. I’m not hiding anything from you anymore. No more secrets.”

Tabeenah nodded, wiping a tear from her eye. “No more secrets.”

For the first time in days, the tension between them dissolved, and the suffocating weight that had been pressing down on Jaisha began to lift. She had her sister back. It wasn’t just her battle anymore. They were in this together.

But just as a sense of relief began to settle in, Jaisha’s phone buzzed again.

She and Tabeenah both froze, their eyes darting toward the screen. Jaisha’s hand trembled as she picked up the phone, her heart racing. The message was from the same private number—the one she now knew belonged to Qasim.

She read it aloud, her voice shaky. “You thought you were smart, didn’t you? I’m not done with you yet.”

Tabeenah’s eyes widened. “He’s still sending you messages?”

Jaisha nodded, her stomach twisting in knots. “He knows we’re on to him.”

Tabeenah’s face hardened. “He’s not going to get away with this, Jaisha. We’ll stop him.”

Jaisha stared at the message, fear and anger swirling in her chest. She was tired of feeling helpless, tired of being scared. Now that she knew who her tormentor was, she wasn’t going to let him control her anymore.

She was going to confront Qasim—one way or another.

As she turned to Tabeenah, her voice was filled with determination. “I’m going to find him, Tabeenah. I’m going to end this.”

Tabeenah squeezed her shoulder, her eyes blazing with the same resolve. “And I’m coming with you.”
