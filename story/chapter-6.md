Title: "Chapter 6 - Again After Hours"
---

The fan skated the air around their ankles. The switchboard made its little electrical sighs like a sleeping cat. If you listened hard enough, you could hear other people’s lives continuing, cups tapping saucers, shoes being kicked off and forgiving their owners, somebody crying into the thick of a pillow and the pillow being too polite to mention it.

At 11:31 p.m., a call came. It showed up as “Private,” which is a word that often means its opposite.

They did not answer.

At 11:44, the hostel group pinged: Water will be off 12 to 3 a.m. “for reasons.”

At 12:01, the electricity performed its nightly theater: went out, remembered itself, shrugged back on. The fan made a decision and then revoked it. The corridor light pulsed, then settled into a new religion.

At 12:07, the door announced a gentle sound. Not a knock. The sound of paper being persuaded under wood.

Neither of them moved. “He didn’t knock,” whispered Tabeenah, as if Unknown had offered them a treat in a form they could chew.

They waited the ritual ten counts of safety. Then twenty because safety of any kind felt greedy.

When they went to the door, the strip of paper lay like a white tongue. It had handwriting in the same schoolteacher neat as the ticket stub, in letters that had rehearsed not being menacing and had failed.

For: 3-B. Invoice.

They did not pick it up. They squatted beside it like archaeologists who had discovered a new kind of grain of sand.

“Why invoice?” said Tabeenah, almost conversationally, as if she were asking the paper about its hobbies. “We did not order.”

“It wants us to look,” said Jaisha. “Even when we don’t open.”

“Should we...”

“No,” said both of them, together.

Unknown had placed it so that the corner was just under the door. When she looked closer, because she could not help herself, she saw that the paper was not blank, not quite. The faintest shadow of letters imprinted as if someone had pressed hard on the sheet before it in a pad.

She went to the desk and came back with a piece of charcoal she hadn’t snapped yet. On her stomach, on the cool floor, she shaded lightly over the page, the way you shade to reveal a watermark.

Letters rose, gray, reluctant. Not many. Enough.

Proof is for strangers.

She sat back. The room felt smaller and also too big.

“Bastard,” said Tabeenah softly, as if addressing the ceiling. “Such a poet. Such a... you know what I mean.”

“Don’t say it,” said Jaisha. “It likes being nouns.”

They left the invoice where it was and put a chair leg on it like a trap. They sat with their backs to the door, as if their bodies could be both locks and witnesses.

At 12:26, both their phones blinked at once. As if someone had switched on a small lamp inside each of them.

Unknown: That’s clever, the rubbing. Sisters are clever when they share.

Delete.

Unknown: Good girls draw inside the lines.

Delete.

Unknown: Sleep. I’ve said this before.

Delete.

“Do we block?” asked Tabeenah, already knowing the answer. Blocking something that knows your corridor felt like telling a monsoon it couldn’t have your balcony.

“What if...” said Jaisha, and then stopped. What if being the whole world too much.

They slept the way prisoners sleep on the night before their innocence is proved for no one.

When morning laid itself, provisional and ordinary, over the outside world, the invoice under the chair was gone.

The chair had not moved. The bolt had not turned. The chain was exactly as they had left it: arrogant, decorative.

They stared at the clean inch of floor where the edge of paper had been. They stared at each other.

“Window?” said Tabeenah, even though the window had bars in a pattern so ugly it was probably effective.

“Witch,” said Jaisha, before she could remind herself to be a modern person.

“Koi na,” said her sister, swallowing her own superstition. “We go to Warden. We go to guard. We become the headache in their day. We make noise.”

“And if noise is the food it’s eating?”

“Then we starve it with a different noise,” said Tabeenah. “What? We stay quiet and become museum pieces? ‘Here on the left, two girls pretending courage is a wall...’”

The room’s lock gave a small contemptuous sound. Not opening. Just... knowing.

They dressed like students because to dress like anything else would be to lose. Jeans, kurta, dignity. When they stepped into the corridor, the corridor looked back with indifference. That was how buildings were. They did not pick sides.

On the landing, the guard with the moustache was whispering with a man in a blue shirt that had “City Couriers” stitched on it in letters that came up from somewhere near Sialkot where embroidery was not a metaphor.

They stopped as soon as the women stepped into view. The guard’s moustache went very still. The courier’s face did a thing like math. He was the right shape to have been the voice at the door. He was also the right shape to be a hundred poor boys trying to make a living not out of malice but out of survival. He looked at them and looked away and looked back, as if his eyes were adjusting to their brightness.

“Invoice,” said the courier man to the guard, too loudly, overcompensating for something they had not accused him of yet. “Last night, I forgot to take back invoice. I was doing my duty, bring it back. I am honest. We are honest company.”

“Men,” said Warden sahiba from behind them, arriving like a clock. “Are not allowed.”

The guard smiled the way a man smiles when someone says a sentence he can turn into nothing. “He is leaving,” he said. “He was telling me he is leaving.”

The courier’s eyes flicked to their door number on the register hanging from a nail as if the number had been waiting for him this whole time. 3-B. 3-B. His mouth shaped it, a small prayer.

“You came at midnight,” said Jaisha, before she could perform the ritual of politeness. “You came at midnight and knocked. You said invoice. Your voice knew what a door is.”

“I came today,” he said, bewildered in a way that could have been real. “First time. I swear on...” He looked around for a thing to swear on and found nothing except the Warden, who would not serve. “On my job. Last night I was at home. My mother has sugar; I was putting her insulin.”

There are lies that go straight to hell and there are lies that stop to help a mother on the way.

“Picture,” said Warden sahiba crisply. “Show me picture from last night of you putting insulin. Everyone takes pictures now. Proof is the new prayer.”

He faltered. “Battery low,” he said, holding up a phone whose cracked screen had the polite shame of poverty. “Nothing saved.”

The Warden took the courier’s ID card the way a judge takes a ring. She wrote on a pad. She told the guard to write. She told the corridor to behave. She told the girls their room was not a road. She did her job. You could feel the job’s limits like tape on the floor.

When they closed the door, the giraffe on the shelf had turned itself around. It was facing out now, its scuffed ear toward the room like an animal finally deciding to stop sulking and start warning.

“Did you...” said Jaisha.

“No,” said her sister.

They stood for a long time, three creatures, two women and an eight-inch toy, regarding each other as if they might be the same problem with different answers.

Her phone trembled on the desk.

Unknown: You see? Men are not allowed. Don’t be cruel.

Delete.

Unknown: Sisters are.

Delete.

Unknown: I said sleep, but you are not listening. I will make it easier.

Delete.

The light in the room changed in a way that had nothing to do with weather. The fan slowed, briefly, and then resumed the pace of a patient person kept waiting.

She walked to the mirror. Her thumb still had its crescent, worn down now to the idea of one. She pressed it to the glass, smeared a softer arc there, a black smile where no one was smiling.

“We are going to the police,” said Tabeenah, not asking for permission from anything. “Today. Now. I don’t care if they laugh. If they want proof, we will bring them petals and invoices and ghosts.”

“And if proof is a kind of cruelty?” whispered Jaisha, the sentence returning like a bird to an old tree.

“Then let them be cruel,” said her sister. “We will be unkinder.”

The door received their motion. The lock took their fingers and made itself part of their plan.

In the corridor, the psychology girl in the green scarf looked up from her phone and said, “Be careful,” like she was lending them a talisman she hadn’t used herself yet.

They made it three steps before both their phones buzzed again in the same breath.

Unknown: Leaving is easier if you don’t look back.

They looked back anyway. The giraffe was still looking at them over its cheap shoulder. It was ridiculous, it was proof, it was a child’s patient witness. It was all the kinds of cruelty at once.

They closed the door, not gently. The jacaranda outside had a long afternoon of shedding planned. The city would go about its business. Somewhere, a boy in a blue shirt would count his wages. Somewhere else, a husband would open his eyes to a day that had decided to be ordinary.

They walked toward the gate together, not touching, a shared shape moving through the space between rules. The moustache stared. The ledger blinked. The world, which had never needed their belief to be real, continued to be so. They would bring their own kind of proof now, and if proof bit, let it bite back.

Behind them, their phones, abandoned for a moment to the table, pulsed once and stilled, the way a heart rests between beats.
