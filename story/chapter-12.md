Title: "Chapter 12 -  The Station"
---

The officer who loved asking if people were sure cleared his throat, a cough that had taken an oath. “Madam,” he addressed Rehana, “do we proceed with FIR? Sections...”

“All of them,” said Rehana. “Add the ones that haven’t been invented yet. We will time travel later and bring them.”

The fan resumed its sermon. The wall calendar considered catching up to the correct date and decided it would be a radical act.

“Mama,” Bilal said around a mouth of biscuit, “this uncle said sleeping is a game.”

“Not anymore,” said Jaisha, kneeling so her eyes could be citizens of his eyes. “Now sleeping is boring. You will hate it. You will fight it. You will lose. That is the rule.”

He giggled, which is a weapon no adult can defeat.

“Show me your hands,” she told him, and he gave them over, solemn as passports. “Left is for courage, right is for careful. Stamp them with crumbs.” He pressed biscuit moons into each palm. “If sleeping is not a game, can it be a race?” he bargained. “Only if you run towards me,” she said, making a roof of her chin over his hair. He fitted himself there, as if the world were a sweater and she knew how to fold it.

“Look at me,” the man in the hoodie said suddenly, as if he had remembered there was a script. “Look at me when I talk to you.”

“No,” said Jaisha, without turning. “You are not allowed.”

The braid’s phone shivered. Evidence grew like weeds: a white car with a thumbprint dent seen by three vendors; a rental agreement that stank of forgery; a contact named “Ustaad” who had taught a handful of boys to be men in the wrong way. The city’s machinery began to chew.

Rehana snapped a glove onto a hand that had seen worse. “Phone,” she said, and the constable upended the hoodie... pockets give up their secrets when they realize they are not pockets but witnesses. The bell clinked onto the table, mortified to be there. The phone slumped next to it, full of little crimes.

“Password?” Rehana asked.

The hoodie man smiled in the way of people who believe themselves mysterious. Rehana looked at the braid. The braid looked at the phone. It opened the way doors open for midwives.

“Of course,” said Rehana. “Men and their birthdays.”

Abbu’s anger sat down finally and turned into a story, the kind he would tell himself at night when nobody was watching. He looked at his daughter holding his grandson and let a new pride come in, take off its shoes, stay.

“Bas,” Abbu said then, voice threaded with command and apology. “Beta, you both will come home with me now. This place... this station, this hostel, this air, has learned your faces. I do not like it. The hostel can have you when you choose, not when a man’s shadow chooses. Tonight you come under my roof. Later if you want, you go back. You return to the hostel when your heart allows, not before.”

Jaisha glanced at Tabeenah, a quick, whole conversation in two blinks and a breath. She smoothed Bilal’s hair, finding the small whirl the world had given him. “Haan, Abbu,” she said, the yes walking out of her like relief. “Tonight we come. We will borrow your roof and return it with thanks.”

Tabeenah nodded, shoulders releasing a weather they had been carrying. “Yes, Abbu. We’ll go with you. The hostel can keep our names warm; your house can keep our bodies safe.”

Warden Sahiba nodded, duty shoes agreeing before she spoke. “He is right. The hostel’s doors are brave but not heroic. We will lock down, put plainclothes on the gate, make registers sign themselves. You go with Abbu, with escort. Come back when you like; I will keep your beds unrumpled and your attendance tyrannically present.” She touched Bilal’s head lightly. “We bully the night from this side too.”

Warden brought water. The glass touched the table like a promise. “Drink,” she told them all, including herself. “Keeping the body ordinary is resistance.”

They drank. The water remembered the river.

“Can we go?” asked Tabeenah, as if the word go could be gently put on like a sweater. “We want to take him home. We need to tell the bed. The bed has been worried.”

“Yes,” said Rehana. “In a while. Statements first. We do the ceremony of paper. Then you go with an escort that will make arrogance lose its appetite. We will also phone the bed. It will forgive us for being late.”

Bilal tugged at his mother’s sleeve. “Will Nana’s house have the moon?” he asked, negotiating from under his eyelids.

“It has two,” said Jaisha, kissing the corner of his mouth and wiping biscuit comets from his cheek. “One in the sky and one in Nana’s steel plate. Both follow good boys.”

“I am good today,” he declared, already half-asleep with pride.

“I will come,” said Abbu, anger now on a leash, loyalty on a throne.

“Men are not allowed,” said the braid again, but this time she smiled when she said it, and Abbu, surprisingly, laughed his small, tired laugh. “I will walk behind,” he compromised, a man learning border discipline.

As they sat to write their day in the grammar of the state, the hoodie man found his voice again, small and eager. “Sister,” he said to nobody who had ever been his sister, “say you forgive.”

Jaisha looked at the man without using her eyes. “Forgiveness is an industry,” she said. “We are not investors.”

She finished her statement and signed her name like she was cutting a ribbon. The pen did not spill. The paper was obedient.

While the ink dried, she made a boat of her palm and set Bilal’s head there. “Count with me,” she whispered. “One train, two train, three train,” tapping his back in a rhythm only sleep understands. His fingers found her earlobe and held it like a handle. “Are we safe?” he asked the way very small kings ask their ministers. “Yes,” she answered, because sometimes truth must be an early guest.

When they stood to leave, Bilal’s hand found her dupatta and recruited it as a rope. He was full and heavy with sleep in that way that makes mothers believe in God again. “Mama,” he murmured, “tell the bed not to cry.”

“We’ll send the bed a voice note,” she promised. “We’ll say, Sleep well without us. We are borrowed.”

The world outside the station had put on evening. The jacaranda had decided purple was not a color but a policy. The SUV waited with its blues asleep. The door to the station opened its mouth and tried to be a blessing.

At the threshold, Jaisha turned back. The hoodie man had been removed, presumably to a room where time moves slower and fans make sermons in a different dialect. She didn’t look for him. She looked at Rehana.

“Thank you,” she said, plain as bread.

“Not done,” said Rehana. “We have his phone. It has friends. We will find the hand that bought the ice cream. We will pull it off the wrist.”

“Patient and mean,” said Tabeenah, a new prayer she was getting good at.

“Good,” said the braid. “Say it to the door.”

They did.

The door listened, proud to be trusted, and let them out. The night was full of kites sleeping on wires, like small, tired truths. Bilal’s head knocked against his mother’s collarbone with the innocence of bells that don’t know what they’re for. Abbu walked a step behind, guard and witness. Warden counted them in the way only women count. The city watched them go and decided, for a few breaths, to be kind.
