Title: "Chapter 13 - Jhelum"
---

The road unspooled like a long, patient sentence, commas for milestones, breath for bridges. Jhelum rose ahead, a rumor of water turning into address. The SUV’s blues peeled away at the city limits, embarrassed to intrude on family.

Abbu’s gate cleared its throat before opening. The courtyard blinked awake, neem leaves performing their tiny green salams. Shoes recognized their owners and came to stand in attention.

“Finally... got my own room back,” said Tabeenah, and the corridor rolled its eyes fondly. She went straight to the old door with the soft paint, shouldered it open with the intimacy of an old joke, and fell backwards onto the bed as if catching history. The mattress oofed, then forgave her.

Bilal walked in ownership circles, touching every wall with one finger, deputizing chair legs, interviewing curtains. “Nana’s house smells like paratha,” he announced. It did. In the kitchen, Ammi was already heating a pan, his hands remembering shapes that comfort the soul: dough into suns, suns into moons, moons into bites a small boy could orbit.

Jaisha set her bag down and her heart down separately. Her phone woke up cranky and showed her a staircase of numbers: 17 missed calls from Rizwan, stacked like insects against a window. She let the glass go to sleep again.

Anger stood just behind her like a bodyguard. It had eaten nothing and still felt full.

Ammi pressed a paratha with a spoon until it puffed its chest. “Beta, eat,” she said to all of them.

They ate in the hum of spoons. Jhelum’s night climbed onto the terrace and lay on its back, counting stars as if they were goats to be herded toward sleep. Bilal invented a game where the salt shaker was a train and the katori was a station and he was the minister in charge of departures. “Tickets,” he demanded, and Abbu passed him pieces of paratha torn into neat squares. Each piece remembered the river.

The phone sang again, that private alarm. Rizwan’s name bloomed, bloomed, disappeared, bloomed. Jaisha washed her hands slower than necessary and did not answer.

It rang in Tabeenah’s room. She tucked the phone under her hair. “Hello?” she said softly, like the word might spook something. She listened, her face a moving weather report. Then she crossed the hall, leaned on the doorframe of the room where Jaisha was tying Bilal’s pajama drawstring wrong on purpose so he could feel useful fixing it.

“At least talk to him,” Tabeenah said, not in the tone of a command but the tone you use to ask the rain to be reasonable.

“No,” said Jaisha, neat and flat, like a door that had learned its hinges. She blew on Bilal’s forehead and he shut his eyes because that was the rule. She spent the next hour building a fort of pillows and small forgivenesses. Bilal arranged his toy cars according to zodiac. They played the game where silence must be fed biscuits so it does not starve and grow into noise.

Night took off its bangles. The house, an old soldier, took first watch.

Rehana texted once: Phone is giving up cousins. Sleep under lock. Will send uniform in the morning. The message wore no makeup; it didn’t need to.

The lock did its work. Dreams came and went, stamp-free.

Morning made itself known with the thin horn of a milkman and the azan stitching the edges of the day. Abbu’s courtyard filled with hot light like a brass plate. Tea agreed to be sweet. Butter agreed to be flamboyant. Bilal agreed to be hungry, which was a relief to everyone.

The doorbell attempted to be modest. It failed.

Rizwan stood at the threshold with his sorry in both hands. He had shaved unevenly, the way guilt does. Sleep had left a mark under his eyes like thumbprints. He glanced past Abbu into the living room, the sofa with its crocheted doilies, the calendar that had finally decided to be correct, and then at the floor, which was safer.

“Assalamu alaikum,” he said to the house, to the history, to the man who could deny him entry.

“Walaikum assalam,” Abbu returned, voice even, as if pronouncing a weather report that could change. He moved aside. “Come.”

The room tightened, then loosened, like a muscle being tested. Tabeenah hovered in the doorway, arms folded, a border with earrings, Jaisha helping Bilal with the coloring. Bilal looked up from his coloring and froze in the position of a rabbit caught considering whether to be a rabbit. “Baba,” he said, trial and verdict at once, and then quickly drew a scribble galaxy that might serve as a bridge if adults didn’t ruin it.

Rizwan stepped in. He smelled of rain that hadn’t happened. “I...” he began, then stopped, choosing which part of the apology to say out loud and which to keep in his pocket to fidget with forever. “I’m sorry,” he finished, the small word wheeling out a big wagon.

“Don’t talk to me,” said Jaisha, not raising her voice, raising her spine. She put the crayon back into Bilal’s fist like she was arming him with color. “You weren’t even there at the police station. You didn’t even care about our child.”

The room nodded minutely, acknowledging the count. Even the fan slowed to hear his answer.

Rizwan’s mouth tried on three explanations and rejected two. “I was on the call with Rehana all the time,” he said finally, each word dressed in honesty he’d ironed hard. “I couldn’t come... there were two men outside my place. I thought they were enemies. I thought if I moved, I would bring them straight to you.” He swallowed. “But seriously, darling. I am sorry.”

The word darling walked out of his mouth and looked around, unsure of where to sit in a room with Abbu in it. It perched on the edge of the table and pretended to be a spoon.

“Two men,” repeated Tabeenah, the syllables measured like they were pills to be taken after food. “What kind of men?”

“The wrong kind,” he said, eyes flicking to Bilal and back. “Rehana said not to shift. She was tracking from there; I was her post. She had me on the line, updates, numbers, those names... Ustaad. If I left, we’d lose the angle. If I came, I could bring a shadow to your door.” He exhaled, a long receipt of guilt. “I chose the phone. It felt like choosing you from far. But I see...” He gestured helplessly. “It did not look like that here.”

“It did not,” said Jaisha. The words were clean, nothing to wash off them. She thought of the station’s door blessing them and how blessings were sometimes thin blankets. She thought of a night that had been kind to them for a few breaths and how a father’s absence could swallow those breaths whole. Anger, who had stood behind her all last night, shifted its weight but did not leave.

Bilal put his drawing into the air between his parents. “This is a boat,” he offered, diplomacy in wax. “We can all sit in it.”

Rizwan smiled without showing his teeth. “It’s strong,” he told his son. “No waves will touch it.”

“No waves are allowed,” Bilal corrected, because rules worked better when they were stated aloud.

Abbu cleared his throat, a cough that was also a map. “Tea,” he announced, because tea was the one language everyone could speak without saying too much. He went to the kitchen, not leaving, not staying, arranging cups like chess pieces that refuse to fight.

“Why didn’t you tell me?” Jaisha asked, not as accusation now but as inventory. “If Rehana asked you to sit still, why didn’t you send me those words to hold while I was...” She gestured in the shape of a station, a statement, a pen that did not spill. “While I was being brave.”

“I called,” he said, looking at her phone on the table, the screen black as a closed eye. “Seventeen times. I didn’t know if not answering meant safe or dangerous or angry. I called Tabeenah...”

“At least talk to him,” Tabeenah echoed her own line from last night, this time as a pale joke to cover color she didn’t want to show.

“I didn’t want your voice,” said Jaisha. “I wanted your feet.” She let the cruelty of it land because it was also the truth. “I wanted you visible.”

Rizwan nodded, taking the hit like something deserved in a ledger he himself had marked. “I will be,” he said. “Visible. Useful. On time. I will do the small father things that are big... morning milk, school run, toy battery, stitches, stories. I will go to the station when called. I will not be a whisper. I will be a wall.”

The tea arrived, steam doing its old prayer. Abbu set cups down with the ceremony of somebody respecting the battle even if they couldn’t fight it. He passed one to Rizwan, and the acceptance was not forgiveness but it was a path.

“Rehana sent this,” Abbu said, holding up his own phone reluctantly. “They caught the car owner. The rental man is already singing. She wants statements from neighbors—Rizwan, she asked if you can give the list of the two men who were outside. You said you saw them.”

“I took photos,” Rizwan said, brightening like a bulb under a lower voltage. He pulled out his phone. “I didn’t go, but I saw. Numbers. Faces. Times.” He placed the device on the table next to the tea. For a second, both phones ignored each other, then began to confer like shy cousins.

“You can send those to her,” said Jaisha, and she didn’t add, Then we will see. The work could be the bridge if the words could not.

Bilal clambered into his father’s lap with the lack of ceremony reserved for those already forgiven by a child’s short memory. “Tell the story of the lion who was not brave,” he commanded.

“I will,” said Rizwan, grateful for such an achievable salvation. “But in my story, he learns.”

“He learns from his mother,” said Bilal, ensuring the plot did not misbehave.

“Always,” said Rizwan, looking at Jaisha and then down into his cup, where his face looked back at him small and distorted and true.

The day moved forward, tossing light like coins into the rooms. Plans got made without trumpets. Rizwan would go with Abbu to the station in the afternoon, document in hand, photos labeled. Tabeenah would sit with Bilal and make paper boats that would sail on the surface tension of a steel thali. Jaisha would call Rehana herself, not to apologize for last night but to add her yes to the work.

When Rizwan stood to leave and fetch the papers he had, he paused at the door. “Thank you,” he said to Abbu, the hardest syllables he had spoken all morning.

“Bring your shadow back with you,” Abbu replied. “We need all of you.”

Rizwan nodded. He looked once more at Jaisha. “I will be visible,” he repeated, like a vow he wanted the door to witness.

“Good,” she said. “Say it to the gate.”

He did.

The gate listened, proud to be trusted, and let him out. The river outside went on doing what rivers do, moving and pretending not to. Inside, the house reset its shoulders. The apology sat on the table between the tea rings and the phones, not flying away, not failing, waiting to be joined by work.

In the courtyard, Bilal launched a paper boat. The small triangle rocked, found its balance, and declared itself a ship. The day, wiser than the night, decided to be kind for a few more breaths.
