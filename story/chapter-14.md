Title: "Chapter 14 - Unexpected Reunion"
---

The calendar sighed and lay down on its back. UOL’s message arrived hand in hand to both sisters, the same sentence in two pockets: University closed until further notice. Political situation in Lahore. Stay safe. It was a thin horn of a notification, trying to sound neutral and failing; politics always leaks its heat.

“Congratulations,” said Abbu dryly, folding the newspaper like a man folding a kite. “You get paid to be my daughters at home.”

“We don’t get paid,” said Tabeenah, but the corner of her mouth agreed with him. Jaisha looked at the message the way you look at unexpected rain on a day you had planned to wear good shoes.

“What will you do with so many days?” Ammi asked, as if the days were mangoes that needed to be eaten before they turned.

“Laundry,” said the washing machine, clearing its throat.

“Work,” said the small stack of notebooks, hopeful. “Sleep,” suggested the pillows, promiscuous with their promises.

Rizwan was visible. He came in the mornings with milk and left with Abbu to the station like they were two reluctant schoolboys carrying a project that promised a grade. He labeled photos with careful fingers, sent them to Rehana, wrote times like tiny ropes tying the past down. He messed with Bilal’s toys until Bilal told him, politely, that he was breaking traffic laws in three countries. He tried on usefulness like a new kurta and found that it fit, not perfectly yet, but more snug by the hour.

Rehana’s texts came like traffic lights, stop, wait, go, in green and yellow and red. Owner’s statement recorded. The rental man named three names and then cried. Two men still blurred, might be hired. Stay put. She didn’t waste punctuation. The story she built was made of checks and boxes and schedules, but under it, a river kept moving, pretending not to.

Time, freed from the tyranny of timetables, grew fat and lazy in Abbu’s house. In the evenings, Jhelum shook dust from its shoulders and lay long across the city. Bilal discovered that paper boats also like bathtubs. He held courts, trials, elections; he declared spoon to be minister and bowl to be the opposition. Someone always spilled water laughing too hard.

On the second morning after Rizwan’s left the house and his apology had sat properly between the them, and refused to fly away, the door knocked with a familiar knuckle.

It was not the modest bell. It was knuckles, a rhythm with the same old arrogance, a drumbeat that had once been the soundtrack to growing up: tah-tah-ta-thum. The gate remembered this beat and snapped to attention. It would have saluted if it had hands.

Jaisha felt it before she knew it. Her feet knew it. Her heart knew it and ran ahead like a child to meet a returning parent. She opened the door and the flight landed into her arms.

“Oh. My God,” she said, a prayer and a slapstick both.

“Your God is my witness, I didn’t even get lost from the bus stand,” said Haider, grinning with his face and with the bag collapsing at his feet. He had brought the smell of airports with him, plastic coffee and overused air, and the faint ghost of European rain. He had a beard that hadn’t decided what country it belonged to.

She hit him in the chest with the flat of her palm, not to hurt but because joy sometimes needs to make a sound. “Idiot. You didn’t tell. When did you come? Why didn’t you tell? Where’s your face? Let me see.”

“This is my face,” he said, turning it left and right like a model demonstrating geology. “Left side survived winter. Right side thinks biryani is a religion.”

“You got... taller?” she accused, squinting at him.

“Flights add three inches,” he deadpanned. “They give them in economy class now.”

She laughed and then her laugh broke into something watery. She pulled his head down and pressed her cheek to the rough angle of his jaw. “I missed you.”

“Same,” he said. The word was not enough, but it was what he had between his teeth. He held her as if she were a country he had always intended to return to.

Behind them, the house woke up further. The corridor remembered how to amplify voices. The dust motes applied for dance permits. Ammi came from the kitchen with her hands in flour, saw her son, and the word beta leapt out of her mouth and grabbed him around the neck. It brought with it a thousand other words that didn’t need saying. She kissed his forehead and left a moon of flour there.

“Germany come, Germany go,” she scolded through tears. “Bus stand say straight ghar, haan? Not hotel, not friend, not any drama.”

“Straight ghar,” he repeated, obedient in the old way. “Hi, Abbu,” he added, when Abbu appeared at the end of the hallway, leaning on the frame as if it had newly become interesting.

“Welcome,” said Abbu, not moving much, because fathers carry their joy in muscle memory. “Bags are heavier when you come home. Strange.”

“They’re full of apologies and chocolates,” Haider said. “In that order.”

Bilal ambushed him at the knees. “Are you the Germany?” he asked, urgent with census-taking.

“I am the Mamu who stole Germany,” Haider said solemnly, scooping him up. “But only the parts with trains. And a tiny snow for your pocket.” He pretended to produce snow from behind Bilal’s ear and the little boy considered it, graciously, for the miracle it was.

“Do you know how to say paratha in German?” Bilal challenged.

“Paratha,” Haider replied, dead serious.

Bilal looked at him with respect. “You’re fluent.”

He set his bag down with a soft thud, and the bag exhaled like a bus that has reached its last stop. Shoes tried to remember how to behave in this house. Haider stood inside his own history and looked around with the clarity of jet lag: the crocheted doilies had not migrated, the calendar had gone correct, the clock near the TV was still convinced that noon should be announced like a minor earthquake.

There are silences a house keeps in one of its old tin boxes. It takes them out only when necessary. One of those lay heavy behind the curtains, watching, as footsteps on the stairs paused and then did not come down.

“Where is she?” Haider asked, not whispering, because the things between siblings do not respect volume. His eyes climbed the staircase as if ascent were possible by sight alone.

Ammi’s hands fussed with nothing. “Upstairs,” she said. The words wore the clothes of other sentences she wanted to say, he is home, she is here, we are old, be easy, but they held their tongue like good soldiers. “She is making fuss with nothing,” she added, to keep her tongue useful.

“Should I...” Haider began, but the doorbell’s memory interrupted with a new tone. The kettle, angry at being ignored, screamed. Rehana chose, in that moment, to send a terse: Keep indoors. Small rally near GT Road. All okay. Haider’s return got the mixed blessing of being one drama among many; Jhelum, generous, always has room for extra.

“Tea,” Abbu decided, which in this house is what you say when gods collide. “We will drink, then we will fight.” He went to the kitchen and the pot adjusted its posture, preparing to be a witness.

“Wash,” Ammi commanded, already filling a steel lota with water because sons stripping the foreign off their faces must be a ritual somewhere. “You look like there is a plane landing on you.”

Haider scrubbed; airports slid down the drain, conversations in German disappeared into the pipes, pretzels surrendered to the laws of drain gravity. He came back different only to himself. He sat and let the cup warm his hands. He watched the staircase and the staircase watched him back, loyal to its job of carrying people up and down and not getting involved.

“Go meet your brother,” Ammi called up, voice threaded with years and commandments.

There was no answer, but sometimes silence is a word. It stretched across the floorboards and pressed its ear to the scene. The house, an old soldier, took second watch.

The accident lives in the house the way a gecko lives in a corner: mostly still, occasionally terrible. It changes walls by just being there. No one had invited it. It had moved into Tabeenah’s body and rearranged furniture, sewed a permanent seam in her smile. That night, years ago, had a street slick with rain pretending to be mirror. Boys called men had laughed with a kind of hunger. Engines had been gods that only took. Haider had driven with the righteous stupid joy of someone who thinks skill can out-negotiate fate. Her husband, Ismail, who had taught Bilal how to make shadows into animals long before Bilal, had been the line between a car and a tree that chose him. The world had decided, and the world had not apologized. Since then, Haider’s name had been a noun that meant both brother and knife in her mouth.

“Go,” Ammi said again, climbing one step so her voice could reach just a little farther.

“Tell her not to go anywhere,” Abbu added, as if he were addressing the wind and not his other daughter.

“I’ll go upstairs,” he offered. “To take Bilal to show the plane in the sky from the terrace. Accidental pass-by.” He lifted the child in question who had already decided that Mamu’s bag surely contained a car with functioning doors.

He took the child and left. On the landing, his steps made polite introductions to the floor, and then the soft murmur of his voice did the work a locksmith might envy. He passed the door. The door was a door. Nothing more, nothing less. Behind it, a breath held and then exhaled at the safe speed of a citizen who wants no trouble.

Haider waited. Waiting is also a profession.

He had thought, on the plane, that apologies could be done in installments. He had prepared sentences and folded them into the inside pocket of his jacket: I am sorry. I was reckless. He didn’t deserve to be the price for my arrogance. I would take it back. I cannot take it back. I see you every day, there, at the edge of my mirror, refusing to step in, and I deserve that. None of these sentences had flown better than the plane. They were baggage; customs would inspect them; he might have to declare them.

When Tabeenah finally came down, the staircase did not announce her, it has manners, but everything else did: the curtain flinched, the fan slowed to watch properly, even the tea cup in Haider’s hand noticed that it was being held now by a different weight.

She stood at the last step, not giving the house the satisfaction of a full entrance. She did not look at him. She wore a kurta that knew better than to try and cheer anyone up. Her face had the peace of a coastline that had been battered long ago and now negotiates only with tide tables.

“Assalamu alaikum,” said Ammi, too brightly, as if greeting her own child could be a rope thrown over a ravine.

“Walaikum assalam, Ammi,” said Tabeenah. Her voice carried no luggage; it traveled light. She did not look at Haider.

He looked. It’s what guilt does; it photographs that which refuses to be framed.

“Bas,” Ammi said to herself, but also to the day, to the fact of this, to the recipe in her head that now needed to add salt. “Just forget that all. Go meet your brother.”

Tabeenah’s nostrils flared slightly, like a horse remembering the track. “No,” she said, almost kindly. “I don’t forget. Forgetting is for misplaced keys. Not for...” She did not finish the sentence; the sentence did not deserve finishing.

Haider put his cup down. He had not yet said her name. Names have sharp edges. He addressed the table instead. “Salaam, Apa,” he said, the old respect careful not to touch anything it might break. “I brought nothing that can help. Only myself. That is not helpful either, I know.”

She laughed once, a laughter without music. “You learned new words there,” she said, finally turning her face enough for him to see the contour that grief had carved. “But you didn’t learn caution.”

“I am learning,” he said. “Slow learner. Late admission.”

“Drop the course,” she said. Her eyes moved to Bilal on the terrace through the open window, to his boat kingdom. “Do not call me Apa,” she added, and there it was, the sound of something closing. It was not a slam; it was a latch that had been installed years ago now being engaged.

He nodded. The nod was the shape of kneeling in a culture where men are not taught kneeling. “Say what you want, and I will receive it.”

She tilted her head, surprised at his obedience like one is surprised when the sea is suddenly polite. She wished to be cruel, and cruelty looked at her with the tireless gaze of a dog that will fetch whatever you throw. She patted it on the head and let it sit.

“I want you not to be in my house,” she said, and the house itself flinched. “I want you not to be in my memories. I want you to give back what you took. I want you to be sixteen and say no to the boy who says, Bas, yaar, one more race.” The room watched the words go around and take their places. “Since you cannot, I want you to stay upstairs when I am down, down when I am up, to forget my tea preference, to forget my birthdays, to be...” she looked at the window, where light was deciding where to sit “...visible enough that I will not smash into you by accident, invisible enough that I can breathe.”

Ammi pressed her lips together until they were prayer beads. “Bas,” she said again, now to both, now to Allah, now to the stupid world that makes mothers know where all the sharp corners are. Tears came to sit at the rim of her eyes; they had paid the entry fee; they were entitled to the view.

Haider wanted to say that he had been hit every day by the absence, that he had gone to the grave, that he had borrowed the German winter’s cold to ice his face, that he knew the man did not die because roads are hungry but because he himself fed them. He wanted to close the distance with a good sentence. He could not find one that did not require him to ask something from her.

“Okay,” he said, and the word did the work of a donkey, carrying more than it should. “I will obey the traffic rules you give me.”

She blinked, not because of the words but because of the tone, which was not Haider’s old tone of making a joke to cover a hole. It was the tone of the boy who had once, after pushing her into a canal with friends, waited an hour outside the bathroom door to hand her a towel when she came out, shivering, and then sat on the floor until she stopped crying, offering his silence like a plate of sliced fruit. She remembered that boy for a dangerous second.

“You don’t bring your death into my house and then tell me to serve it tea,” she added, lower. “I have enough ghosts.”

In the doorway, the gate, who had let so many people out and in, who had listened to vows, considered the metaphor and felt both accused and proud.

Abbu, who hated theatres that did not sell tickets, stood up. “Haider will sleep upstairs in the store room,” he decided, dictator of bed assignments. “He will eat when we eat. He will not enter the kitchen without permission. We are not animals. We are a family.”

“That is unfortunately the same thing,” said Tabeenah, but without venom. The anger behind her moved to one side like a bodyguard making space for someone small to pass.

Bilal, who had been listening with the rapt attention of a boy watching adults play chess, came in with a boat on his palm. “This one is for Mamu,” he announced, placing the paper triangle on the table between tea rings and apology. “It is a good boat. It will not race. It will only go on picnics.”

Haider swallowed, the way you swallow when something soft is killing you completely. “Shukriya, Chief Minister of Boats,” he said, and picked it up as if it were written with the rights of the child.

Ammi exhaled a prayer. It came out as a shopping list: salt, patience, clipped words, more salt.

Afternoon put its arm around the house and squeezed hard. Plans arranged themselves. Haider carried his bag up to the store room, the stairs counting each step with petty satisfaction. He did not knock on the door he passed. He did not say Apa again. He placed the chocolates on the top shelf like a bribe to a god he did not believe in. He stood among suitcases and seeds and the smell of old books that had not been useful for years. He put his forehead against the cool wall and let it take some of his heat.

Downstairs, Tabeenah stood in the courtyard and watched the neem leaves do their small green salams. She thought of Ismail’s laugh, which used to walk into rooms before him, and then of the silence that had taken its shoes off and stayed. She thought of the race. She thought, briefly, of what the word race does in a country like this—of who gets to run and who is made to watch. She was tired of thinking. She folded her thoughts into the pocket of her kameez the way one might fold a letter when one is not ready to read it.

“Rehana says keep indoors,” said Jaisha, coming to stand beside her without touching. “So stay. At least for today. We have more days now. Lahore is... busy being Lahore.”

“Jhelum is busy being Jhelum,” said Tabeenah, because she needed to say something that had no corners. “Do you love him... I mean Rizwan?” she asked suddenly, turning to her sister with a cruelty that was not aimed at her.

“‘Yes,’ said Jaisha, without melodrama. ‘And I will make him earn the visible in it.’

‘Earn the visible,’ repeated Tabeenah, and for the first time that day, the words made her smile, the smallest legal smile possible under the circumstances.

Evening arrived wearing a dupatta that caught on every nail. The city murmured slogans two neighborhoods over and the goat next door disagreed loudly with the thesis. Ammi put oil in the pan and the onion surrendered, little martyrs. She sent Bilal to summon Mamu to peel peas, because punishment and reunion sometimes look identical under fluorescent light.

Haider came down obediently, rolled his sleeves, and put his hands to the work of peas. Small green futures popped free under his thumbs. He did not look at the staircase. He asked Ammi if the knife was sharp enough. He remembered to sit when Abbu sat, not before. He ate what was put in front of him and did not ask for more, which was in itself a miracle.

But Tabeenah did not speak to him, and did not want to. She passed him like a closed door that had decided its job. Ammi noticed. Jaisha noticed. The noticing collected in the corners like dust that refuses to leave.

Later, in the kitchen, Haider took a box of chocolates from his bag, the good kind, shaped like little maps, and placed it on the top shelf beside the tin of cardamom, where it could be seen but not reached without decision. He did not write a note. He did not say sorry. Courage was a staircase he could not climb tonight; anger was a dog he did not want to wake.

At night, the house tried on peace again. It was tight in the shoulders. Everyone pretended not to notice.

Then Ammi stopped pretending.

‘Bas,’ she said, the word putting on her mother-commander boots. She brought both of them to the sitting room as if arranging furniture for a storm. ‘Dono idhar. Abhi.’

Haider stood ready, palms empty. Tabeenah stood resistant, spine like a locked cupboard.

‘Hug him,’ said Ammi, not as suggestion, as law.

Reluctantly, Tabeenah stepped in. The hug was a bridge hammered together by orders; it held, it creaked, the river below remained unchanged.

‘Apa... please,’ Haider said into her shoulder, voice small and blistered. ‘It was a mistake. Forget that.’

‘Don’t say...’ Tabeenah began, the sentence sharpening.

Ammi’s hand found her arm, warm, firm. ‘Bas,’ she said again, and the blade of the sentence slid back into its sheath.

The chocolate waited on the shelf like an apology still in its wrapper. The gate, who had been told earlier to be witness to a vow, repeated it back to itself quietly, like a poem it wanted to memorize. I will be visible. Good, answered the hinges. I am tired of surprises.

In their room, after Bilal had told the lion story and appended an amendment about no racing ever in the jungle, Jaisha lay with her phone face down, then face up, then face down. She typed Rehana: Brother came. House is a border. UOL closed. We are here. She deleted the last sentence, then sent the first two, then threw the phone on the bed like a coin into a wishing well.

On the terrace, night wore Tabeenah like a shawl. Somewhere upstairs, her brother held a paper boat in his large hand and looked at it as if it might become a passport.

‘Say something to the gate,’ she said to nobody, and to Allah, and to herself. ‘Say it hears.’

The gate, proud to be trusted, swung a few inches open and closed, a nod, a bow. It understood what it could. It would stand. The house reset its shoulders. The apology did not fly away. The work waited, patient as a river pretending not to move. And the smallest boat, faithful to the laws of paper and men, took on a little water and still did not sink.”
