Title: "Chapter 8 - The Wrong Door"
---

They turned the fans to three because three was a superstition with a switch, and superstition is just courage with beads. Airplane mode went on like a polite lie. WiFi stayed, because even lies need a window. “This is the one good thing the hostel did,” said Tabeenah, patting the router’s invisible head. “They feed the ghosts too.”

They picked up their bags. The chain preened at the doorframe. The giraffe, nosy by nature, had moved just enough to be in the photo if anyone took one.

The call came before the corridor could decide whether to be a corridor or a stage. WhatsApp. Green ring. Husband’s number. The photo was still him, grainy, holding Bilal like a fresh sentence. The way old things become evidence because you never thought to hide them.

“Hey,”. He breathed like someone in a stairwell. “Is Bilal with you?”

The room found a cliff and ran off it. “What?” said Jaisha, and the word was too small to be chosen but no larger word came forward.

“I was at the office... I had a quick... just a quick work to do,” he said, already pleading with his own grammar. “He was with the nanny. I was about to drop him at your parents’ house. But...”

“Rizwan,” she said, and her heart skipped the beat it saves for ambulances. “Where is he?”

“I don’t know,” he said, and in the background a chair corrected itself, a keyboard remembered how to be mute. “And I am sorry. I am sorry.”

She cut the call. Anger is sometimes forgiveness with its skin inside out. The screen inhaled. Another call immediately, video this time, no name, just a number that looked like a rumor.

“Don’t,” said Tabeenah, because Rehana’s voice lived in her now: Do not reply to him unless I say.

But the word “don’t” arrived too late to catch the green button. The picture opened like a trap laid to look like a window.

Bilal. Eating ice cream like it was his job and the world paid generously in sticky happiness. The camera was too close, then pulled back: a bench the color of old government notices, trees in pairs, the washed laughter of noon. Somewhere a vendor rang metal on metal, a bell that had been bribed to be cheerful.

“Baby,” said Jaisha, a different animal now, a sound she did not know she could make. “Where are you?”

“Mamma, I am in the park,” he said, ice cream mustache making a joke the universe was in no mood to laugh at. “Uncle...”

The camera tilted. The Uncle was the same guy from the street... black hoodie, black mask, a white of eye like chalk. The body that could be anything. He didn’t bother with the angle. He stepped into the frame as if being seen were a profession.

“Your kid is so sweet,” he said, easy like a man in a bakery recommending a pastry.

Something in the room cracked and reassembled. The girl who always practiced gentleness found her fingers making fists. “Listen to me,” said Jaisha, and her voice was a knife that had stopped apologizing for being a knife. “If anything happens to my boy, I will find you. I will chew through your mask and your hoodie and your God and I will end you with my hands. Do you understand me? Give him to the nearest policeman and sit on the grass and wait for me to come break your face.”

Tabeenah stared. She had never met this sister who spoke like a woman with an earthquake obedient under her feet.

The masked man chuckled, a sound like a shoelace tightened. “Men are not allowed,” he said, almost teasing. “You know this. And yet you are calling men into it.”

“Then be a man,” said Jaisha, the word poison now. “Or be a crow. I don’t care what bird you are. Show me where. Right now. Pan the camera. Show me a signboard.”

“Proof is for strangers,” he said, patient as a teacher reciting a nursery rhyme. “We are family now. Family doesn’t ask for proof.”

“Don’t hurt my boy,” said Jaisha, and there was iron in it, an anvil where her throat used to be. “You touch a single hair and you will regret you ever met a phone. You will regret your hands. You will regret your mother’s labor.”

“Shhh,” he said, all softness, a counterfeit lullaby. “Regret is for mothers. You’ll understand.”

“Show me where you are,” she pushed, the blade of command steady, the edge hot. “Turn. Pan. Now.”

He lifted the camera closer to Bilal’s cheek. Skin and sugar, pink and melt. The world behind dissolved into a blur like privacy pretending to be mercy.

“Portrait mode,” Tabeenah said in a whisper that was part curse, part compliment. He was not stupid. The background was a rumor; the sky was a rectangle of light; all true things were out of frame.

“Say Allah Hafiz,” the man crooned, ignoring geography like it was a suggestion. “Say it properly. Slowly.”

“Bilal,” said Jaisha. “Look at me. Mamma’s here.”

“Mamma,” he chirped, entirely himself, the sound a straight line through the mask and the man and the city.

“Good,” said the man. “Now you listen... no police. No men. WiFi on. Airplane mode on. If I hear anything... sirens, boots, uniforms... I hang up, and the world learns how quiet a park can be.”

“You so much as make him cry and I will make the alphabet out of your bones,” said Jaisha. “Do you understand me?”

“I understand,” he said, almost tender. “Obedience is a language. You will speak it. We will talk again.”

The screen went black with the efficiency of a guillotine.

What was left in the room was not silence; it was the sound grief makes before it chooses a shape. It dripped. It pressed. It forgot how to be dramatic.

Jaisha tried to cage the cry with her teeth and failed. It left anyway, raw and private, the kind you don’t do in front of strangers and today every wall was a stranger. She folded at the bed the way a letter folds when it has too much to say. Knees to the ground, forehead to the mattress, hands learning to be empty.

“Okay,” said Tabeenah, kneeling, making the floor an altar for practicality. “Okay, okay, okay.” She stroked her sister’s hair like she was trying to teach it the direction of safety. “He was eating ice cream,” she said, throwing the fact like a lifebuoy. “He is in a public place. He sounded... fine. We will make him more fine. Breathe. Then we do.”

“I’ll kill him,” said Jaisha into the cotton, not a threat but a wish that had found a sharp edge.

“You will hug your son,” said Tabeenah. “I will do the killing if killing needs doing.”

She took the phone like it might try to bite and placed it face down on the table, beside the charcoal sliver that had survived thefts and mornings. The giraffe watched as if finally earning its salary.

“Rehana,” said Tabeenah, dialing with hands that had practiced steadiness all morning and were now being examined by their teacher. The call thunked through the city’s pipes.

“Listen,” said Rehana’s voice on the second ring, as if she had picked up inside their room. There was always the impression with her that she had been listening since before you were born. “Tell me everything. Slowly. Which parts are the parts.”

“He called. WhatsApp. Video,” said Tabeenah. “Close. No background. Portrait mode. The sky was a postcard. He didn’t show anything, ma’am. He said... no police, no men. He said he would hang up if he hears sirens.”

“Screen record?” Rehana asked, without blame, like a doctor asking if you had breakfast.

“I tried,” said Tabeenah. “I have... six seconds. The boy’s face. His mask. Nothing around.”

“Send me the six seconds,” said Rehana. “And the call time. And the number. And your husband’s number. The nanny’s full name, if God has been kind enough to let her have one.”

“Rizwan,” said Jaisha hoarsely, lifting her head as if air were a heavy pot. “He lost him.”

“I know,” said Rehana. “He is crying like an apology that thinks it is a plan. I have him on another line. We will pass him alphabet soup later, let him spell his guilt. For now: you keep WiFi on, data off, no replies unless I tell you. If he calls, you answer. You say as little as possible. You do not ask for pan or proof; he will not give it. He’s careful. He knows cameras like water knows hands.”

“What do we do,” asked Tabeenah. Not a panic question. A logistics one.

“I send watchers,” said Rehana. “Not heroes. Women where possible. Plainclothes. All parks within the triangle of your hostel, your parents’ place, his office. This city has too many benches pretending to be each other. He gave me no trees, no walls, no letters. Fine. Then we hunt by sound. I’ll strip your six seconds to its bones, vendor bells, bird calls, generators with a cough, what we can. Might be nothing. We’ll chase nothing until it becomes something.”

“Ma’am,” said the constable at their door, softer than he had ever been, like he was reading a book to a sick child. “Should I call Safe City?”

“I already did,” said Rehana, and you could hear the stamp in her voice. “PPIC3 is listening for someone who thinks he is smarter than a city. But WhatsApp is a snake in a basket; it sings, you clap, nothing to trace in the moment. We will still look for the hand that holds the basket. Meanwhile, you two... do not be brave. You are not a lesson.”

“He told us to go to class,” said Tabeenah, because information is also obedience.

“Good,” said Rehana. “If he expects you to go to class, you will go to class. With a woman constable five feet behind you and a man you pretend not to see ten feet behind her. If he wants theatre, we seat him in the audience and sell him a cheap ticket. Keep the phone ready. Speaker off. Airplane on, WiFi on. You do not set your life to silent; you set it to watchful.”

“I can’t breathe,” said Jaisha, honestly, like a child reporting the weather.

“You can,” said Rehana, calm as a jug. “Because your child is breathing. He spoke. He ate. Men like this like to perform. They do not usually break their toys during the show. Do you hear me? We are in the show, not the end.”

“I should have...” began Rizwan on some other line in some other room inside Rehana’s conversation, his voice small and irritating like a mosquito with a degree.

“You should have been born an umbrella,” Rehana told him, and hung him up delicately. Then to the sisters: “Nanny’s name?”

“Sumbul,” said Tabeenah. “From Shahdara. Mid-thirties. Two front teeth with a little space. CNIC...wait...” She dug into the bag, into the pocket that remembers. She found photocopies, a refugee camp of rectangles. “Here.”

“Send,” said Rehana. “We’ll find her door. We’ll find the last gate she walked through and the first lie she told. Qaiser is on the roznamcha. Your complaint number stays under your chair leg. Good. We will give it a brother number by sundown.”

The phone vibrated once on the table, a sly heartbeat. Unknown: a new message that arrived like a fly and left like a ghost. They watched the preview bloom and disappear. Proof tries to live; deletion tries to be God.

“He’s testing,” said Rehana. “He wants to see if you are ceramic or tin. Mute the notification pop-ups. Not the calls. We need him hungry.”

“What if he...” said Jaisha, and the sentence stood there, headless and terrifying.

“If he wanted to hurt the child,” said Rehana, not promising but inventorying, “he would not have called you first. He needs you in the audience. He needs your eyes. We will use your eyes to catch his hands.”
