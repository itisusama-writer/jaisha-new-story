Title: "Chapter 2 - The Weight of a Name"
---

Morning in Lahore arrived like a slow burn, sunlight pressing through the thin cotton curtains of Razia Hostel, turning dust motes into drifting embers. Jaisha woke before the alarm, her body already coiled tight from the night’s ghosts. The phone beneath her pillow felt heavier than it should, a stone in the bed of a river that refused to flow.

She didn’t check it.

Not yet.

Tabeenah was still asleep, curled on her side with one arm flung across the mattress like a child guarding a secret. Jaisha watched her for a moment, the rise and fall of her chest a quiet rhythm against the silence. Then she slipped out of bed, careful not to wake her, and padded to the washroom.

The mirror showed her what she already knew: sleep had not come easy. Shadows pooled beneath her eyes, and her lips were bitten raw from the inside. She splashed cold water on her face, the shock sharp enough to cut through the fog. In the steam that rose from the tap, she traced the word *Qasim* with her fingertip, then wiped it away as if it might stain the glass.

Next morning she dressed quickly, jeans, a loose kameez, her dupatta folded and tucked into her bag. The sketch from last night lay untouched on the desk, the smudged corner still there, still accusing. She avoided looking at it.

Breakfast was a lie. She chewed a piece of toast without tasting it, the memory of the last message lodged in her throat like a bone.

The campus was already alive by the time she reached the Arts Building. Students spilled from the canteen with steaming cups of dhoodh patti, laughter bouncing off the brick walls like loose marbles. Jaisha kept her head down, her bag clutched tight against her side. She could feel eyes on her... always did, but today it felt different. Not curiosity. Not envy. Something sharper.

She stepped into the lecture hall just as Professor Nadeem began calling roll. The room was half-full, sunlight slicing through the high windows and pooling on the wooden floor. And there, in the third row, near the aisle, Qasim.

He sat with his shoulders hunched, his fingers tapping restlessly against his notebook. He didn’t look up when she entered. Didn’t glance her way. But she saw the tension in his neck, the way his jaw tightened when someone dropped a pen behind him.

*He’s here.*

The thought hit her like a slap.

She took a seat in the back, far enough to watch, close enough to strike. Her pulse throbbed in her temples. Every breath felt like a countdown.

The lecture droned on, something about postcolonial narrative structures, about silence as resistance, but Jaisha heard none of it. Her gaze never left Qasim. The curve of his ear. The way he scratched at the inside of his wrist when he was nervous.

She remembered the rumors. The hearing. The way his name had been whispered in corridors like a curse. *Released. No charges. Insufficient evidence.* She remembered the look on his face the last time she saw him.

But last night’s messages... they weren’t the ramblings of a broken man. They were precise. Calculated. *Intimate.*

At the end of class, she waited.

Students filed out, chatting, shoving notebooks into bags. Qasim lingered, pretending to organize his papers. She stood and walked toward him, each step heavier than the last.

“Qasim.”

He looked up. His eyes, dark, tired, widened slightly. “Jaisha.”

“You were released,” she said. Not a question.

He nodded once. “A week ago.”

She crossed her arms. “And now you’re back.”

“I had to finish the semester,” he said quietly. “They let me return on probation.”

She stepped closer. “Did you message me last night?”

His brow furrowed. “What?”

“Don’t play stupid.” Her voice was low, trembling with fury. “The texts. The ones that knew where I slept. What I wore. What I drew.”

He stared at her, stunned. “I didn’t...”

“Don’t lie to me.” She leaned in, her voice a blade. “You knew about the lilac. You knew about Bilal. You *knew*.”

He flinched. “Jaisha, I swear... on my mother’s life, I didn’t send you anything. I haven’t touched my phone in days. I’ve been staying at my uncle’s. I don’t even have Wi-Fi.”

She searched his face for deceit. For the smirk that used to curl at the corner of his mouth when he thought he’d won. But there was nothing. Just exhaustion. Just fear.

Then... *ping*.

The sound was soft, but it cut through the emptying classroom like a knife.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket.

She didn’t move. Didn’t breathe.

Qasim watched her, confused. “What was that?”

She pulled the phone out slowly, her fingers numb.

Unknown: You look prettier when you’re angry. But don’t waste it on him.

Delete.

Her stomach dropped.

Qasim hadn’t moved. He was still standing two feet away, his hands open at his sides like a man surrendering. He hadn’t touched his phone. Hadn’t glanced at a screen. Hadn’t even blinked.

It wasn’t him.

The realization hit her like a punch to the ribs. She swayed slightly, gripping the edge of a desk.

“Jaisha?” Qasim’s voice was soft now, almost concerned. “Are you okay?”

She didn’t answer. She turned and walked out, the hallway stretching like a tunnel before her.

Back at the hostel, Tabeenah was waiting.

She sat on the edge of Jaisha’s bed, arms crossed, eyes sharp. The chai she’d made sat untouched on the table, already gone cold.

“Where were you?” she asked, no teasing in her voice this time.

“Class,” Jaisha said, dropping her bag by the door.

“Don’t lie to me.” Tabeenah stood. “You left before I woke up. You didn’t answer my texts. And when I passed the Arts Building, I saw you arguing with Qasim.”

Jaisha froze. “You were watching me?”

“I was worried.” Tabeenah stepped closer. “You’ve been jumpy since last night. Pale. Distracted. You didn’t even hear me when I asked about Bilal’s video.”

Jaisha turned away, staring at the window. The jacaranda tree swayed slightly in the breeze, its lilac petals trembling.

“Tell me what’s going on,” Tabeenah said, softer now. “Please.”

Jaisha opened her mouth. The words were there, *someone’s watching me, someone knows too much, I’m scared*, but they stuck in her throat. She thought of the last message: *Tell your sister good night.* She thought of the threat coiled inside it like a snake in silk.

If she told Tabeenah, she’d be in danger too.

But if she didn’t...

Tabeenah reached for her hand. “Jaisha. I’m not stupid. I know something’s wrong. And I know it’s not just Qasim.”

Jaisha looked at her then, really looked. Saw the worry in the tightness of her jaw, the love in the crease of her brow. This wasn’t just a sister. This was the only person who had held her through panic attacks, who had sat with her in hospital waiting rooms, who had lied to their mother so Jaisha could stay in Lahore for her degree.

She couldn’t protect her by silence.

But she couldn’t risk her by truth.

“I...” Her voice cracked. “I don’t know who it is.”

Tabeenah’s eyes softened. “Then let’s find out.”

Jaisha shook her head. “You don’t understand. This person... they know things. Little things. Private things. They were *in* the room last night, Tabeenah. Or they were watching. From outside. From somewhere.”

Tabeenah’s face went still. “Have you reported it?”

“To who? The hostel warden? The campus security? They’ll say it’s a prank. A glitch. That I’m overreacting.”

“Then we go to the police.”

“And say what? ‘I got disappearing texts from a number that doesn’t exist’?” Jaisha laughed, bitter and broken. “They’ll laugh me out of the station.”

Tabeenah was quiet for a long moment. Then she walked to the door, checked the bolt, the chain. She pulled the curtains halfway shut, not all the way, but enough to blur the outside world.

“We’ll figure this out,” she said, returning to sit beside Jaisha on the bed. “Together.”

Jaisha wanted to believe her. But as she reached for her phone, against her better judgment, another message blinked into existence.

Unknown: Sisters are such fragile things. Handle with care.

Delete.

She turned the screen off quickly, but not before Tabeenah saw the flicker in her eyes.

“Jaisha,” Tabeenah whispered. “What did it say?”

She shook her head. “Nothing.”

But the lie tasted like ash.

Outside, the sun dipped behind the jacaranda, casting long shadows across the floor. Somewhere in the hostel, a door slammed. A laugh echoed down the hall. Normal sounds. Safe sounds.

But Jaisha knew better now.

Safety was an illusion.

And the watcher was still watching.
