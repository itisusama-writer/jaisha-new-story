Title: Chapter 11 - A Borrowed Capture
---

The camera changed. The sky became a ceiling. The light became a strip that had decided it was bored of being a strip. A hand... different, older... moved into frame. It held a police cap. Another hand... bare, younger... reached for it like a thief would reach for a halo. Applause somewhere off-screen, a little too soft, a little too planned.

Rehana’s message hit like a drum.

Rehana: We have a suspect. Black hoodie. Generator. He ran into our uncle’s arms. He was wearing the arrogance of someone who thinks he is invisible. We are traveling. Station now. Come.

Warden stood; the chair forgave her. “Move,” she said, and the library recoiled at the word. The braid was already on the phone, calling ahead. The librarian stamped the silence one last time as if to remind it who owned the building.

They were a small procession again. The corridor tried to trip them, failed. The guard’s mustache lowered itself respectfully. The campus gate opened like a mouth that wanted to prove it had teeth. The city outside wore the afternoon heat like a badge. A police SUV had the blues tucked away, quiet. They fed themselves to the car.

The drive was a lesson in every possible wrongness. Motorbikes made rules out of smoke. A bus sang. A goat tried to be a cloud. The braid held her radio with casual affection, like a person hold a child who has not yet learned betrayal. Rehana’s messages bounced like a ball they were keeping off the ground.

Rehana: He is in cuffs. We are careful. No celebration, save it for after we see the boy. The generator is ours. It hummed and then surrendered. The vendor ran. We offered him a job. He refused, says he does not do honest work.

Rehana: Bring no men. Your father is at the station anyway because life is a comedian. We are hiding him in a side room with tea. He is learning humility.

The station tried to be a station. It tried to be justice. It tried to be a tree. It failed at all three but made a decent attempt at being a queue. The dusty fans here were older; they believed they had seen everything. The wall calendar was stuck in some past few days where everything had almost been solved.

A constable outside escorted them in with a chin. “Madam,” he said to Warden with respect that tasted like cumin. The braid, now in her natural habitat, grew taller by a centimeter.

They were led to a room that was doing its best to be a room. A man sat on a chair. He wore a black hoodie that had dreams about America. His face was a smudge trying to be a face underneath stubble that had not been properly briefed. He had a bell in his pocket, a stupid little bell that rang with guilt when he fidgeted. He looked like a person who had borrowed the idea of villainy from a film and not returned it.

“Is this him?” asked someone who loved it when it was his turn to ask.

The braid watched, eyes making a list. Warden breathed a breath that wanted to become someone’s forgiveness.

The room leaned in.

Abbu was already there, tea in hand like a regret that had been poured and left to cool. His anger had parted his hair better than any comb could. “Where is my grandson?” he asked the air, then the table, then anyone who dared be a person.

“Bring the child,” said the braid, and the order walked out of the room on a constable’s legs.

The man in the hoodie looked up through his stubble and tried to arrange his face into a face. The bell in his pocket gave itself away again. His smile was a nail that had failed carpentry school.

“Where is the boy?” said Rehana, voice without adjectives.

He shrugged, a small stage on which nothing worth watching was happening. “Safe,” he said, trying on empathy like a shirt from a shop he couldn’t afford. “We are not monsters.”

“Speak for yourself,” said Warden Sahiba, and her duty shoes softened into something maternal that could kick if it had to.

Abbu took a step that turned into a prayer. “If he has touched even a hair...”

“Abbu,” said Tabeenah, quick as a stitch, “save your hand. Save it for blessing.”

The door opened like it had been practicing its whole life. The constable returned with a small gravity on her hip. Bilal. Star sticker on his forehead, king of tiny countries; lion bandage on his finger, king of tiny hurts. His eyes were tired in the expensive way. He held a biscuit he had been convinced was a key.

“Mama,” he said, and the word went across the room like a bridge that had been waiting for its river.

Jaisha broke and became whole in the same movement. She caught him; he climbed her like he had never learned the word no. That first sound she made did not belong to human language. It belonged to whatever language doors speak when they finally open.

“It’s okay, it’s okay,” she said, and the old lie became a new truth. “You don’t have to be brave now. You are allowed to be small.”

“I am fastest,” he told her shoulder, muffled. “I won the race.”

“You win,” she said, kiss-kiss-kiss, forehead-sticker, hair, eyes. “You win everything.”

Abbu’s hand hovered above the boy’s head like a helicopter that had learned manners. He patted, three times, grandfather magic, and whispered a sura through his mustache. His anger had nowhere to sit. It stood in the corner and stared at the hoodie.

The man in the hoodie watched their love like a thief watches a lock. “Good girls,” he said, and the two words were a match, cheap and proud of its spark.

Jaisha turned. The room adjusted to keep from breaking. “You...” she began, but language quickly realized it did not own enough knives. She placed Bilal on the bench beside Tabeenah; Warden’s arm found the boy’s shoulder and became a fence made of kindness. Then Jaisha moved.

She crossed the room without touching the ground, or so it seemed. The braid was fast, but fury had a head start. Jaisha’s palm found the front of the hoodie, fabric and bone; the bell in his pocket snitched again. She pulled him forward inch by inch until he had to look up at her and remember he was made of meat.

“I told you,” she said, so quiet that even the fan stopped to eavesdrop. “If he cried, I would come and show you the inside of your own voice.”

The man smiled badly. “He did not cry,” he said. “He is a good boy. You should thank me.”

Rehana’s hand arrived, precise, at Jaisha’s wrist; her other hand pressed the table, anchoring the room. “Not here,” she said. “Not with him. Not like this.”

“He will not be able to make another mother’s words neat,” said the braid, moving to flank, voice gentle as a seatbelt. “But he must do it in court. Let the law be the knife. Keep yours clean.”

“I want to kill him,” said Jaisha, not whispering, not asking permission from the air. Around the sentence, everybody in the room remembered how to breathe.

“You want your son more,” said Rehana. “And you have him. He is the project now. If you break this man with your hands, they will turn you into the story, and he will get to be a complication. No. Keep your anger. We will spend it with receipts.”

The hoodie man blinked, discovering that women could be a weather system. “I only took—”

“You took time,” said Tabeenah, stepping beside her sister so their shoulders became a single decision. “That is theft in the first degree.”

“Also a child,” said Warden, whose voice had steel teeth when required. “That is everything-degree.”

Abbu moved forward, the tea glass finally remembering it was glass and clicking onto the table. He raised his hand. The braid touched his elbow, not quite a stop, not quite a blessing. Abbu made his hand spend itself on Bilal’s hair again. The boy leaned into it with the greed of safety rediscovered.

“I am hungry,” Bilal announced to no one and the idea of mercy.

“Food,” said Warden, already alchemizing bureaucracy into sandwiches. “We will commit a pakora crime.”

The station remembered it was a station: phones ringing like stubborn birds, a typewriter somewhere trying to be a drum, paper wearing signatures like medals. A lady constable brought in a plate... the old kind with the enamel chipped in a way that turned into a map if you squinted, and put it in front of Bilal with a ceremony meant for kings. He ate with the insistence of the acquitted.

Rehana leaned in toward the hoodie man, professional as a scalpel. “Names,” she said. “Numbers. Who sent you. Who paid. Who taught you to hum generators into phones. Speak.”

The man tried to arrange a shrug and found his shoulders wet cement. “You have me,” he said. “Why do you want anybody else?”

“Because you are small,” said Rehana, kind as winter. “And because boys do not kidnap themselves. And because there is a hand behind your hand, and we like to shake hands.”

“Men are not allowed,” muttered the braid, which made one of the constables snort and then become very interested in the ceiling.

The hoodie man’s eyes flicked to the boy, then back to the floor, where his courage had chosen to nap. “We only wanted a lesson,” he said, almost to himself. “Women must learn obedience.”

“Women must learn patience,” said Tabeenah. “And mean. We are top of the class.”
