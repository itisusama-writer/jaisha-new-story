Title: Chapter 3 - The Shape of Proof
---

By afternoon the heat had softened, but not enough to be kind. The jacaranda outside Razia Hostel held its breath; petals clung and then let go as if giving up a secret. In the corridor, the faint smell of fried onions and cheap detergent mingled, the scent of hundreds of ordinary lives rubbing against one another.

Jaisha told herself this was good. Ordinary was a blessing.

“Your criticism is at four, na?” said Tabeenah, pinning her dupatta with a neat, stubborn hand. She wore mustard today, rich and warm, and a thin silver chain that flashed when she turned her head.

“Haan.” Jaisha closed the lid of her laptop, the slides tucked inside like folded, fragile birds. “I’ll be back by Maghrib.”

“Eat something first.”

She made a face. “Khawas will have samosas.”

“You’ll faint and blame me.” Tabeenah thrust a banana into her hand. “Doctor’s orders.”

“Since when are you a doctor?”

“Since you decided sleep is for villagers.” She softened. “Message me before you enter the class.”

There was comfort in being mothered by a sister who was only a few years older. It made the world feel briefly contained.

They stepped into the corridor. The light there was different, thin, a little dusty, the kind of light that showed you what you didn’t want to see. On the floor, under their doormat, someone had arranged jacaranda petals in the shape of a crescent. Not a perfect moon, but a bent arc, the exact negative curve she’d used the night before where the light in her sketch caught on the bend of the trunk.

Her body misfired. For a second, she couldn’t tell if she was remembering the sketch or being shown it.

“Tabeen...”

“I see it.” Her sister’s voice was carefully empty, an outline waiting to be filled. “Maybe some girls from third floor? They’re doing a floral rangoli down the hall.”

“They don’t come this way.” It came out sharper than she meant. She bit the inside of her cheek. “I’m overthinking.”

“Or someone’s bored,” said Tabeenah. “Let’s kick it aside.”

“Don’t,” said Jaisha, surprising herself. “It’s... pretty.”

They stepped over the crescent in an awkward half-hop. As they passed the alcove where the old payphone used to be, a draft licked at their ankles. Downstairs, a scooter coughed and caught. Somewhere a TV played a drama softened by distance.

The ping waited until they reached the lift.

Unknown: Mustard flatters her. She should wear it more.

Delete.

The metal doors reflected a warped version of them: two faces stretched, two bodies shivering in the dented steel. For a second, both women forgot to breathe.

“Show me,” said Tabeenah.

“It’s gone,” said Jaisha. Her mouth was dry. “But it was there.”

“What did it say?”

“Nothing.”

“Jai...”

The lift arrived with a jerk. They got in. Six steps from the lift to their door, she heard in a voice that was not hers. Seven if you’re scared. She punched the ground floor button harder than necessary.

At the gate, a group of boys in black backpacks argued about football, their voices careless, bright. The guard barely looked up. Sunlight pooled on the road outside, vicious and white. They walked to the bus stop in the umbrella of their shared silence.

The Arts Building lobby was cool and echoing. On the bulletin board, a poster for an upcoming exhibition had been pinned crookedly so the artist’s name leaned away from the title: Unknown. It made her stomach flip.

Her classmates spilled into the seminar room with the practiced chaos of late semester. Sprawled notebooks, dented water bottles, nervous jokes. Professor Nadeem adjusted his glasses like a man bracing for a storm of mediocrity.

“You’re up, madam?” he asked, not unkindly.

She nodded. “Yes.”

The projector hummed to life. Slide one: Her title in a simple font, the image of her charcoal jacaranda washed pale by the light. The smudge in the corner, where someone had signed what she hadn’t, sat like a bruise. She hadn’t been able to scrub it clean.

She began to speak. About light and absence. About repetition as testimony. About fragments refusing to resolve into a whole and what that meant in a country where women learned early to live in the gaps.

She was steady. She could be steady.

On slide four, the projector flickered.

It was nothing, a hiccup in the current. In Lahore, power had a mind of its own. The image snapped and returned, then snapped again. She kept talking; she had learned to sail through load-shedding like everyone else.

Then for exactly one heartbeat, the screen showed a photograph that was not hers.

A domestic softness flooded the white. A child in a blue pajama set asleep on his side, mouth open the way he slept when he was too tired to close all the way, one arm flung up as if to catch a dream before it fell. The corner of a striped bedsheet she knew better than her own breath. The top of a man’s hand, blurred, the ring catching the flash.

Then it was gone. Back to her slide. Back to charcoal. Back to theory.

She stopped speaking mid-sentence. The room breathed. Someone coughed. A pen clicked and clicked.

“Continue,” said Nadeem, mild, unaware. Or pretending to be.

Had anyone else seen it? She glanced at the rows. One or two faces were blank in a way that wasn’t neutral. One girl’s mouth had turned down in a pity she couldn’t disguise. Qasim, seated near the wall, stared at the table as if something on the wood was suddenly fascinating and would not look up.

She swallowed. “As I was saying...”

Her mouth kept talking. Her hands kept moving. Inside, a small animal thrashed.

After, when it was over and the clapping was politely quiet, Nadeem came up as the others began to gather their things.

“Good structure,” he said. “Tighter language would help on slide three. And...” his eyebrows made a puzzled roof... “be careful with personal material next time.”

“What personal...” She cut herself off, made her mouth into a reasonable line. “Sir, can I see the copy on the machine? Just to check the export.”

He gestured to the old desktop in the corner. She inserted her USB, opened her file, slid to slide four, five, six. Nothing but what she had put there. She navigated to the machine’s temp folder. Nothing. She clicked the projector input. The tech squealed and calmed.

“See?” said Nadeem, glancing at his watch. “Glitch gods. They eat and run.”

It was such a light thing to say, and it made her want to scream.

Outside the seminar room, under the bareness of the high corridor, she took her phone out. A message waited like a breath being held.

Unknown: He dreams of birds. You do, too.

Delete.

She didn’t realize she’d sat down until the floor chilled her through her jeans. She counted the perforations on the metal bench until numbers felt like prayer.

On her way out, Qasim passed her without meeting her eyes. He had always been a man who needed eye contact like oxygen. Now he looked at the brickwork instead.
