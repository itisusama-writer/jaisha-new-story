Title: "Chapter 7 - The New Prayer"
---

Morning pretended to be innocent. It slid into the hostel through the bars, through the jacaranda's blue fatigue, through the corridor where last night's whisper still clung to the paint like steam.

They went back for their phones because the world had taught them you don't leave your heart or your evidence on a wooden table where a giraffe can look at it and learn. The giraffe had turned again, they noticed, now not facing the room or the wall but angled, as if trying to hear both. A compromise animal. A witness pretending to be decor.

They gathered the boxes, the one with charcoal, the new one with its smug tape, the invoice folded into a plastic sleeve as if that could shield letters from intention. They took their bags. Jeans, kurtas, faces that had done the work of the night.

“Koi na,” said Tabeenah to the mirror, to the phone, to the door. She said it to courage as if courage were late to class. “We go.”

On the landing, the mustache was already there like a statute. The guard examined their boxes the way men examine women's choices. “What is this drama now?” he said, not unkindly, just as someone reciting a line he had loved since boyhood.

“Police,” said Tabeenah. She put the word down between them like a brick.

He breathed through his mustache as if it were a separate creature. “If Warden Sahiba...”

“Warden Sahiba will meet us there,” said Jaisha. It wasn't a lie, not yet. Some lies become true if you say them to the right door.

Outside, the city was washing its face. Tea stalls unwrapped their metal. A rickshaw performed a hymn to combustion. Street dogs held their committee.

They did not argue about walking or riding. They walked first, because walking is a prayer for control, and then they rickshawed, because control has a fare.

The rickshaw's mirror was a square of sky that kept wincing. They held the boxes between their knees like eggs you can't afford to drop. The invoice crackled with its own self-respect. The charcoal smelt faintly like all the drawings they had not made yet.

Two streets from the station, where the trees leaned in as if to become hair for the road, the world acquired a dot. A small hard circle behind the soft of Tabeenah’s back, the way a period arrives at the end of a sentence you were not ready to finish.

“Move,” said a voice she recognized the way you recognize a childhood fever. Calm and tired and clean, with that slight amusement like a blade polished too often. “And I will shoot. Drop everything and go back.”

They did not turn. The rickshaw was still moving; the city was still happening; the driver’s eyes stayed on the mirror because sometimes men know when to be blind.

“Drop it,” the voice said. The muzzle pressed once in punctuation.

They let the parcels tilt out of their hands and into the world. The invoice, the boxes, the night. Their bags slid too, out of habit. He sighed. “Not your bags, you stupid. Pick those up and leave.”

They picked them up. The indignity was almost tender in its clarity. They stepped forward the way you step into a photograph you don’t want to be in.

The rickshaw did not speed up. He was professional with his slowness. He drifted. On the count of ten, which is the number courage likes to pretend it is, Jaisha turned her head because she had been born treacherous to fear.

Black hoodie. Black mask. The kind of body that could be a courier or a clerk or a husband or a ghost, which is to say it was a body. He was already stooping, scooping. The boxes made small domestic sounds. The invoice flashed its white like a fish in a net. He did not run. He was both patient and brief. He existed only long enough to collect what belonged to them by theft.

They reached the station with their bags, which suddenly felt like survivors who did not deserve the honor.

The police station was the color of old lemons. Its fans had been in government service longer than some wars. A calendar showed a month that was not this month, which meant someone had stopped wishing things would change on the first of anything. A map on the wall had faded into a geography of blame.

“Application,” said the duty officer without looking. “Father’s number.”

“We have our numbers,” said Tabeenah, and put both phones on the desk like two reluctant fish. “We have messages. We had, he stole, he put a gun...”

“We will not say gun just like that,” he said, with the lawyerly patience of a man who has seen too many guns and too many lies. “Did you see?”

“I felt,” said Tabeenah, and put her hand on her own back as if she could show him the punctuation there. “We both heard.”

“Private number?” said the duty officer, like a man asking if water was wet. He finally lifted his eyes. His name badge said something with a Q in it, which is a letter that always looks like it is trying to escape.

They slid the phone toward him. On the way over, the lock screen had bloomed with previews, Unknown, Unknown, Unknown, each line a small knife. By the time the phone touched his desk, the thread had eaten itself. The chat was a clean bowl. He peered. He scrolled. His eyebrows read only the absence.

“Earlier,” he said, a word that does the work of both belief and doubt.

“Last night,” said Jaisha. Her mouth felt like paper. “And just now, he took the parcels. The invoice. He told us to go back.”

“What did the messages say?” he asked, performing the ritual of question marks without the luxury of proof.

“They said,” Tabeenah counted them on air as if the lines were beads, “That’s clever, the rubbing. Sisters are clever when they share. And... Good girls draw inside the lines. And... Sleep. I’ve said this before. And... Leaving is easier if you don’t look back.”

“Where is this invoice now?” he asked, performing the ritual of question marks.

“Gone,” said Tabeenah. “He is the kind that eats proof.”

“Proof is the new prayer,” came a voice from the doorway, brisk as a bell. “And prayers need witnesses.”

The woman wore a uniform that fit like a decision. She was not older; she was practiced. Her name plate read Rehana in letters that had learned to mind their own business. She took them to a smaller room where a plant had been trying to die for a year and had, perhaps out of respect, agreed not to.

“Sit,” she said. She poured water into paper cups that had met better mouths. “Tell me the story slowly so I can hear which parts are the parts.”

They told it. The ticket stub that had behaved like handwriting. The invoice that had behaved like a ghost. The courier. The Warden and her laws with tape on the floor. The giraffe, no, they did not say the giraffe. Some things you keep because you need one witness that is not tired.

Rehana listened without the interruptions men use to show they are paying attention. When they were done, she said, “Write. Full names. CNIC. Guardian's contact. Hostel address. Phone numbers. Give me your phones for five minutes. We’ll make copies of the messages." 

"But... There were no messages. Unknown messages deletes itself." Jaisha said, She didn't lie but it looks like a lie.

"He is some kind of a hacker. He did not want to leave any trace." Tabeenah added.

"Okay... We will make a roznamcha entry. FIR is later. Without identity of accused...” She paused, allowed herself to hate the sentence. “We will still put a line in the book that says you told someone who had a stamp.”

At the desk, Q-with-the-badge put a thick register on the counter. It sighed like an old animal. He unscrewed a pen cap as if he were unsheathing a sword made of plastic. “Date,” he said. “Time. Complainant.”

They wrote their names. They wrote the story. They did not embroider; their thread was done.

The landline rang. On its small display, very modern for a thing that looked so tired, a word blinked: Private.

Q looked at Rehana. Rehana looked at the ringing like it was a child who had done this before. She lifted the receiver the way you lift a sleeping cat that might decide to be a snake. “Police Station,” she said, and waited.

A familiar voice came down the line as if it had chosen a different corridor to arrive by. “Don’t be cruel,” it said, almost shyly. “Men are not allowed.”

Rehana made a face that was a paragraph. “Who is this?”

“Proof is for strangers,” said the voice, sweet as a nail. “You are not strangers to anyone. Be kind.”

The line clicked into nobody. The fan above them turned over a new religion and then back.

Rehana put the receiver down like a cup that had tried to bite her. “Good,” she said, her eyes sharper now. “We have a voice in the station. We can write that. Qaiser”, so that was his Q...“note that at [time] an anonymous caller made threats to the complainants via our line. Put it in.”

Qaiser's mustache, which was less expressive than the guard’s but more well-funded, flinched. He wrote. The pen left a groove deeper than ink.

“CCTV at hostel?” Rehana said. “Working?”

“It is there,” said Jaisha. “Which is not the same.”

“Call your Warden,” Rehana said. “Put her on my phone.” Her phone was heavy, institutional, with a scratch down its face like someone had once insulted it and it had tried to slap them.

Warden Sahiba answered in a voice like duty in comfortable shoes. Rehana explained without apology. There would be a visit, there would be a request for footage, there would be a question about the courier boy and his blue stitched shirt from Sialkot. Warden Sahiba said all the right words. You could hear the job’s limits like tape on the floor again, but this was different tape. This tape came with ink on it.

“We will send a constable to escort you back,” said Rehana, putting the phone down. “Not because it will change anything but because the world understands uniforms the way it understands teeth.”

“We don’t want to go back,” said Tabeenah, surprising herself. The sentence had been chewing on her from the inside since the rickshaw. “We want to go anywhere else that is not predictable.”

Rehana looked at the clock. The clock refused to look back. “Do you have family here?”

“No,” said both of them, an old answer. Their family existed like two cities away from Lahore.

“Then for today, hostel,” Rehana said. “We will take your statements formally this afternoon. I will call the telecom to start the letter for the number even though it is a number that wears a veil. You will go in a police car because I am not interested in how brave you are. You are not a lesson.”

On the way out, Qaiser tore a scrap from a pad and wrote their complaint number on it in digits that had done this too often. He pushed it across the desk, a small paper that had been allowed to be proof.

“Don’t lose this,” he said, and then, because the world likes to echo its criminals, “Be kind.”

“Kindness is not our subject today,” said Tabeenah pleasantly.

The police car was full of yesterday’s cigarettes and the kind of hope that smells like paperwork. The constable in the passenger seat was young enough to believe in muscles. He looked back at them in the rearview mirror with a sort of clumsy concern, the kind that wants to help by lifting heavy things no one can see.

“You girls study what?” he asked.

“Psychology,” said Jaisha, before she remembered psychology belongs to the girl with the green scarf on their corridor, not to her.

“I.T.,” she corrected herself. “And drawing things too.”

He nodded as if that was both war and bakery.

The street had discovered noon and was pretending not to like it. They stopped for a donkey cart that had decided against being a car. They stopped for a marriage procession rehearsing for some night in some future where people had the energy for flowers. The world did not know about their complaint number. It continued to be real anyway.

At the gate, the mustache stood straighter than he had ever stood for them. Uniforms grow entire centimeters out of the ground; it is one of their small magics. The guard looked sorry with his whole body. He had the courage to look at them, which is rare.

Inside, the corridor attempted indifference and, failing, did a quick version of it. The psychology girl in the green scarf lifted a hand from her phone. “Be careful,” she said again, like someone who had discovered the word could be glued to any emergency and still look helpful.

Warden Sahiba performed her job with precise hands. She would show them the CCTV even though the CCTV would show them it had not been watching. She would bring register and signatures and ID card photocopies into the same room and make them stand next to each other until they behaved like a plan. She shook Rehana’s hand like women shake hands when they have decided to forgive each other in advance for being from different departments of the same sadness.

The constable stood outside their room with the posture of a man pretending to be a door.

Inside, the giraffe had moved again. It stood with both ears forward, as if finally deciding to be a predator of information.

She found the charcoal sliver in the bottom seam of her bag, a fragment that had pretended to have been lost when they had dropped everything on the street. It had stayed. Of course it had stayed. Everything that could be counted had left; what was not exchangeable remained.

On her stomach again, as she had been on the cool floor last night, she shaded. Lightly. The way you shade when you suspect erasure is also a witness. The table gave them back a tired gray phrase, not whole, never whole, but enough to be the same old insult dressed for daytime.

Pro f s fo str nge s.

“Proof is for strangers,” read Jaisha gently, filling the shoes of the missing vowels.

“Bastard,” said Tabeenah to the ceiling. “Such a recycling poet.”

A knock on the door that wasn't a knock. The constable. He kept his voice respectful, hostel rules, women, Warden’s eyes. “Madam, CCTV shows nothing,” he said. “Night camera off after twelve-five. The guard wrote here ‘load-shedding’.” He made the word do its other job: to explain cowardice.

Rehana took pictures. She photographed the table's reluctant confession from three angles, with the flash on, with the flash off, with her phone and with the station’s phone, as if redundancy itself could be a kind of shrine.

Her own phone barked a notification. She lifted it the way you lift a letter that may be a bill and may be a bomb.

Unknown: Diary numbers are not diaries. They don’t remember you the way your pillows do.

Unknown: I told you to sleep.

Unknown: Men are not allowed. Sisters are. I am teaching you to draw outside.

All the messages deleted themselves one after the other.

Rehana’s jaw did a small, private thing. “Good,” she said to no one. “He is talking to the wrong phone now.”

“Is there a right phone?” asked the psychology girl, who had drifted to their threshold like a green comma.

“Every number is a door,” said Rehana. “We will find a draught.”

After the consultation ended, after the constable had been fed a glass of water and an opinion, after Warden Sahiba had promised to print the hostel’s register again with ink that would not be a metaphor, Rehana took their statement on a neat form that had learned the shape of fear. She made them read it aloud because reading your own pain in a neat font is sometimes the only way to drag it through the world.

“We will ask the telecom for CDR,” she said. “We will ask the courier firm for logs. We will ask the city for nothing because the city is too large to be asked things. You will not go alone anywhere today. You will keep your curtains rude. You will keep your phones in airplane mode when you are trying to be a person, and on when you are trying to be an exhibit. Do not reply to him unless I say. Understand?”

They nodded. Understanding is a kind of politeness too.

When she left, the room exhaled. The constable peeled himself off the corridor and became a man again. The corridor, tired of all this, remembered it was just a place to pass through.

They sat with the chair leg on the complaint slip, like a trap for nothing. The paper made a small crinkling that felt like a heartbeat trying out a new rhythm.

“Our bags,” said Jaisha suddenly. She unzipped the inside pocket that had felt funny since the rickshaw. Her fingers found a flatness that had not been invited. A square of flimsy thermal paper hid there, the kind that turns brown if you keep it near light, the kind that shrugs into blankness like an old man. It had numbers. It had their room: 3-B. It had a line that said Paid. It had, in faint gray, a sentence that was not part of any receipt.

Proof belongs to whoever writes it.

She held it between thumb and forefinger. The paper tried to pretend it was nobody. The letters tried to behave like accidents of the printer's head. The giraffe looked on, its ear turned as if to catch the part of the sentence no one else could hear.

“Do we give it?” asked Tabeenah. “To Rehana. Do we make it another diary number.”

“If proof is a kind of cruelty,” said Jaisha, and now it was not a whisper, not a resignation, but a test of the room’s echo, “then we will be unkinder.”

They sent the photo to Rehana with no caption. They placed the receipt under the chair leg too, next to the complaint number, museuming their own morning.

Outside, the jacaranda honored the afternoon with more purple surrender. Somewhere, a boy in a blue shirt counted his small money and tried to put together a story that would not make him sound cheap. Somewhere else, a man in a black hoodie measured a day by how many girls it could be taller than.

Their phones pulsed once, then stilled, then pulsed again. Rest between beats. Work between rests. A rhythm you could live inside, if you agreed to be both funerals and newborns.

Unknown: You are not listening.

They did not reply. They turned the fans to three because three felt like a spell and a room needs spells.

“We are going to class,” said Tabeenah suddenly, and smiled with half her teeth. “Because nothing eats a monster like a timetable.”

“Okay,” said her sister. “But we sit by the door.”

The lock, hearing its cue, made a noise that meant it would try. The chain preened, decorative and arrogant. The room watched them leave. The corridor measured their shape against the rules and decided, for now, to let them pass.
