Title: Chapter 1 - The Sound of Pings
---

The ceiling fan in Razia Hostel whirred like a tired bird, chopping the warm Lahore evening into steady breaths. Beyond the grilles of the window, the jacaranda tree held on to pockets of lilac, a memory of spring clinging to summer’s end. Paint tubes lay open on the study table; a charcoal stick rested across an unfinished sketch of branches bending toward light.

Jaisha sat cross-legged on the bed, her dupatta wrapped around her shoulders, phone propped against a stack of books. The screen lit up with her husband’s face, fuzzy around the edges, as if the distance had rubbed him thin.

“You look tired,” he said, voice clipped by the lag.

“I’m okay,” she smiled. “Just a long day. How’s Bilal?”

“He’s here. One second.” The camera swung, blurred, then steadied on a small boy with crescent eyes and a sleepy yawning mouth.

“Meri jaan,” her voice softened, breaking in the middle like old glass. “Oh, baby, Mama miss you!”

“Mama,” Bilal sang, and his face filled the screen, nose smushed against the camera.

“Oh my baby,” she cooed, hand instinctively reaching out to touch a face that wasn’t here. “Bilal, did you eat your paratha? Hmm? Show Mama your chapli smile.”

He grinned, gummy and ridiculous, and her heart pressed itself against her ribs as if trying to get out and go to him.

“Mama, bird,” he pointed at something off-screen.

“Bird? Wow, my smart boy! Mama loves birds too. Mama loves you more.” She blew kisses. “Pakka promise, jaldi milne aao gay, hmm?”

From the doorway, Tabeenah entered balancing two chipped mugs of chai, her bangles whispering at her wrist. She placed one by the sketchbooks and sat against the wall, pretending to busy herself with the hem of her kurta while sneaking glances at the screen. Her mouth softened; she wasn’t immune to the trance of a toddler’s face either.

“Assalamualaikum, Bilal!” she called out cheerily.

“Ala...la...laikum,” he tried, and both sisters burst into laughter.

“Bas, bas, let him not turn into an imam over the phone,” her husband chuckled from somewhere behind the camera. “Say bye to Mama. It’s bedtime.”

“Bye Mama,” Bilal said, the word “bye” stretching until it became a small plea.

“Allah hafiz, meri jaan. Acha bacha, brush karna. Mama loves you,” she whispered. “Oh baby, Mama miss you. Mama miss you.” She pressed her lips to her knuckles and held them up to the screen like a charm.

Ping.

A notification flashed, then faded from the top of her screen before she could read it. Unknown number. Her mind barely registered it, a gnat in the sun.

“How’s your hostel?” her husband asked, taking the camera back.

“Crowded,” she said lightly, sliding a glance at the locked door. “But safe.”

“Safe,” he echoed, as if testing the word. “Call me if...”

“Shh, don’t start,” she warned, teasing to keep his worry from blooming. “Everything’s fine.”

Ping. Ping.

The pings came again, quick as skipped pebbles. She shifted her phone slightly so the notifications wouldn’t cover Bilal’s face. Maybe a class group. Maybe Sara sharing a meme. The screen’s glow reflected in her tea; her stomach tightened without reason.

“Okay,” he sighed, relenting. “I’ll call tomorrow. Inshallah. Take your vitamins, haan? And try to sleep early.”

“As if you sleep at all,” she said. “Allah hafiz.”

“Allah hafiz.” He lingered for a second longer, the way people do when there is something unsaid. Then the call ended. The room exhaled.

The fan ticked. The jacaranda outside didn’t move.

“Show me the monkey again, na?” Tabeenah grinned, still in the afterglow of Bilal’s mangled salam.

“Later,” Jaisha said, reaching for her mug. Her hand trembled; a small ring of tea shivered.

Ping.

She unlocked her phone. The messages sat like little black fish in a white stream, each one marked by an unfamiliar number with too many digits, the way online accounts sometimes masked themselves.

Unknown: You look better in lilac. The blue makes you timid.

The text disappeared.

Unknown: Stir your chai, Jai. It’s getting cold.

The text disappeared.

Her throat went dry. Her name. No one called her Jai. The phone felt too warm in her hand.

Unknown: Don’t worry. I knocked. You didn’t hear.

The text vanished too, as if swallowing itself. Each message blinked into life, then faded a heartbeat after she read it, leaving only a blank timeline and the memory of words.

“What is it?” said Tabeenah, catching the way color drained from her sister’s face.

“Nothing,” she lied automatically, forcing a smile that felt like paper. “Group spam.”

Unknown: Razia Hostel looks prettier from the east side. Your window doesn’t shut properly.

Delete.

Unknown: Six steps from the lift to your door. Seven if you’re scared.

Delete.

Unknown: Don’t call for help. It makes you ordinary.

Delete.

She stared at the glass as if it would start bleeding. The smell of chai turned bitter. The fan’s steady chop became too loud.

Her thumb hovered over the call icon. The number had no name. No photo. No trace. Just the sense of breath close to her ear.

“Jaisha?” Tabeenah moved closer. “Your hands...”

“I’m fine,” she said, pulling the phone to her chest. She swallowed hard, taste of rust on her tongue. A rumor from a week ago flared and refused to die: Qasim’s hearing. The easy, poisonous word that had swept the corridors that morning. Released.

As if the thought had scented the air, another line lit the screen.

Unknown: Jails are classrooms if you pay attention.

Delete.

Her eyes jumped to the door. Bolt. Check. Chain. Check. She fought the urge to pull the curtains tight; sometimes fear was a beacon for the very thing it feared. Breathe, she told herself, the way Arham had taught her once. Box your breaths. Draw the fear like a shape. She traced a square on her thigh with a shaking finger and inhaled.

“Tumhari video call theek thi?” asked Tabeenah, deliberately casual. “Network kharab to nahi?”

“Haan,” she answered too quickly. “Just... low signal.”

Ping.

Unknown: If you tell her, I will make her beautiful in fear.

Delete.

Her skin crawled. The brutality of gentleness in that sentence almost made her gag. She felt suddenly like she was holding a live wire nobody else could see.

“What happened?” Tabeenah said again, reading the familiar crease between Jaisha’s brows. “Koi baat hai? Did he say something?”

The impulse rose to throw the phone at her, to lay the room open, to say his name aloud and watch it become a stone they could fling away together. But the message sat like a knife in memory. She pictured fear flickering across Tabeenah’s eyes, and Qasim... no, stop, whoever this was, winning that small, sweet cruelty.

“Bas,” she said, voice softening into apology. “Thak gayi hoon. I think I’ll sleep early.”

“Hmm,” said Tabeenah, not convinced. She wasn’t easy to fool; worry had carved a keen intelligence in her. “We’ll lock the door. Double. And I’ll make you chamomile.”

Chamomile... the word was a warm towel on a fevered forehead. It made her want to cry.

“I’ll be fine,” said Jaisha, shifting to put the phone face down on the bed. Her heart hammered against her breastbone, trying to get out. Somewhere below, a scooter coughed in the hostel parking, a footstep echoed in the corridor, and then, silence. Outside, a petal lost its grip and made an invisible sound as it fell.

She turned the phone over again, unable to help herself. Another text waited, a tiny, patient mouth.

Unknown: You forgot to sign your sketch. Don’t worry. I signed it for you.

Delete.

Her gaze slid to the desk. The charcoal drawing, the jacaranda, the bend of its trunk, the stubborn tilt of light, stared back at her. The bottom corner, where she always initialed in small, private strokes, was smudged with what looked like the shadow of a fingerprint. She forced a laugh. Ink, she told herself. The charcoal had caught her skin when she moved the paper. You’re inventing monsters in the folds.

Yet the messages were not invented. They were there and then gone. Each one taking her breath with it.

“Bilal ki video save ho gayi?” asked Tabeenah, trying to break whatever she sensed slipping away from her sister.

“Hmm.” She locked her phone and slid it under the blanket, the way children hide diaries. “He said ‘alaikum’ like an astronaut.”

They both smiled, and for a second there was a thin, bright surface to stand on. The room filled with the quiet comfort of people who had learned to claim small islands in rough seas.

Ping.

Even muffled, the sound burrowed through cloth. She didn’t reach for it. It reached anyway.

Unknown: Tell your sister good night.

Delete.

She pressed her lips together until they hurt. The desire to fling open the door, to scream down the hallway, to run, was almost intoxicating. But she had run before. And it had only taught the hunter how fast she could go.

“Good night,” she said instead, soft, too soft. “Do you want the window shut?”

“Leave it,” said Tabeenah, surprising her. “The night’s finally kind.”

Kind. She studied her sister’s face. There were lines there she hadn’t noticed before, left by nights sitting in hospital chairs, by waiting through exams, by silently catching all the small, falling things Jaisha dropped when the world trembled. She wanted suddenly to tell her everything—about the lilac, the blue, the steps from the lift, the fingerprint where a signature should be. Instead she reached for Tabeenah’s hand.

“Thank you,” she said.

“For what?”

“For the chai.”

“For Bilal’s ‘ala...la...laikum’?” she teased.

“For being here,” she meant.

After the lights were off and the fan kept marking time, after the corridor noises thinned and night settled like a shawl, the phone glowed under the blanket, a small, stubborn moon. One last message waited, polite as a knock that wasn’t there.

Unknown: I am home.

Delete.

Her eyes burned. In the dark, the jacaranda in her drawing looked like a map she couldn’t follow. She tucked the phone beneath her pillow, as if closeness could reverse gravity, as if her skull could crush those words into dust.

I won’t drag her in yet, she told herself, wrapping both arms around a fear that felt like a child left outside. Not yet. Not tonight.

Across the room, Tabeenah turned in her sleep and murmured something too soft to catch. The fan went on slicing the dark into quarters. Somewhere, in a place that had once felt like safety, the distance between a door and a bed shrank by a step.
