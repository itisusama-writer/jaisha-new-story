Title: "Chapter 9 - A New Door"
---

The giraffe shifted its gaze to the window as if it too were expecting a police siren to knock politely. The jacaranda outside made its purple mess like a blessing that had forgotten how to be neat.

“Get up,” said Tabeenah to her sister, not unkindly. “Wash your face. He cannot have our salt.”

They went to the basin. The mirror held their morning like a border guard, inspecting, stamping, letting through what it understood. Eyes red, mouths set. Sisters with new teeth.

“Is it my fault,” asked Jaisha, voice sinking under the question like a stone.

“Fault,” said Tabeenah, “is an industry. We are not investors.”

There was a knock that remembered to be a knock. Warden Sahiba stood with a woman constable whose braid looked like it could beat a man to death if it had to. “Beta,” said Warden, and her duty shoes softened into something nearly maternal. “Come. We sit outside your class. We do class like a siege. You will fail to learn anything. This is fine. We will sign registers anyway.”

They moved. The corridor tried to be normal, failed, tried again. The psychology girl in the green scarf lowered her phone and hoarded them in her eyes, which is the only safe way to hoard living people.

“Baji,” she said, to nobody and to the idea of support. “He was eating ice cream. Allah is watching the hand that buys ice cream.”

“Allah watches everyone,” said the constable.

They walked to class in a procession of silence: two sisters, a braid with a badge, a Warden wearing regret like a ring, a constable pretending to be a shadow. The hostel gate looked at them and tried to be a gate. The guard’s mustache saluted without permission.

In the classroom, the fans rehearsed their spell. The timetable lay there with its small tyrannies. “Networks and Security,” read the chalk on the board from some yesterday. The irony clapped quietly in the back row.

They sat by the door. Of course they did. The door leaned in, proud to be trusted.

“Phones on the table,” murmured the woman constable, taking the seat behind them like a guardian angel who had passed the exam. “Screen brightness low. Ear to the glass, not mouth. Record button ready. You breathe. I watch.”

Rehana texted: I need the husband’s office location. Sending plainclothes there. And a sofa, in case he faints. Also: any news from parents’ house? Any enemy with a face? Any debt with a throat?

Tabeenah typed back: Parents on their way to station. No enemies we admit to.

A reply dot pulsed, thoughtful. Keep this tone. It confuses men.

At the front, a teacher wrote three bullet points and forgot what bullet points do. The class tried to be a class and failed with dignity.

The phone buzzed again, the way a snake might nudge a basket from inside. The same number. Video. No name.

“Answer,” breathed the braid.

They did. The screen filled with exactly what a man shows when he understands the value of absence: Bilal’s mouth, sticky; the ridge of a black sleeve; the slope of a mask. The world beyond was the color of nobody. If there had been a tree, it had been taught to be a cloud.

“Good girls,” he said, indulgent, as if he were correcting their handwriting. “In class?”

“Yes,” said Tabeenah, keeping her voice at room temperature.

“By the door?” he asked, sweet as a nail.

“We like exits,” she said.

“Me too,” he said. “Remember the rules.”

“Remember mine,” said Jaisha, and the iron was back, newly polished. “You don’t let him fall. You don’t make him afraid. You keep his hands clean. If he cries, I will come and show you what the inside of your own voice looks like.”

“Ah,” he said. “Anger. It suits you. It makes your words neat.”

He tilted the camera to sky and blue and nothing. A kite tried to write a clue in the corner but had been taught to be polite. The bell that had been cheerful before resumed its job and became anonymous again.

“Bye for now,” he said. “Be students. Learn obedience.”

The call ended itself. The class went on pretending to exist.

Rehana’s message arrived before sorrow could get its shoes back on. Audio sample received. Vendor bell profile matches ten parks. Useless. But the electricity hum is a clue. It hums like a generator with asthma. Which parks have load-shedding at noon? Fewer. Which ones are near schools with afternoon recess? Fewer. We are squeezing. Hold. He is careful. We will be patient and mean.

“Patient and mean,” repeated Tabeenah under her breath like a new prayer.

The hour bent itself into strange shapes. Every laugh in the corridor was an alarm until it wasn’t. Every footstep was a soldier. The woman constable learned the room’s breathing and synchronized to it. The green scarf girl sat two rows away and pretended to care about a diagram while staring holes into the future.

Another buzz. The number again. Message only this time.

Unknown: Leaving is easier if you don’t look back.

Unknown: Sisters will learn to sit still.

Unknown: Men are not allowed. You have been warned.

The thread attempted to eat itself; the copies in Rehana’s phone had already been fed. Somewhere inside the city’s machinery, a request wore a stamp and chewed through signatures.

When the bell for class rang, stupid and faithful, the corridor exhaled and inhaled and exhaled again. The woman constable touched the back of Jaisha’s chair, not quite a pat, not quite an order. “We stay moving,” she said softly. “Statues crack.”

Outside, the jacaranda continued its slow purple generosity. Somewhere, a boy finished his ice cream and licked his wrist where it had sprung a river. Somewhere else, a man in a black hoodie measured control like a miser counts coin.

“Don’t hurt my boy,” said Jaisha again, this time to no one, practicing, a vow sharpening itself. “Or regret will learn my name.”

“Good,” said Tabeenah. “Say it to the door.”

The door listened. It had been waiting all its life to be the right door.
