Title: "Chapter 15 — The Hour"
---

The house wore silence like a starched kurta again. It looked neat from far and scratched the skin up close. Ammi noticed. Jaisha noticed. Noticing piled up in corners like dust that refuses to leave.

At breakfast, Tabeenah moved around Haider the way a river moves around a rock it has decided not to forgive. Haider, for his part, tried to learn the art of being smaller than his shadow. The chocolate he had bought for her sat high on the kitchen shelf beside the cardamom tin, an apology still in its wrapper, hoping elevation might count as intention.

“Bas,” said Ammi, banging a spoon gently against a cup. The spoon made the sound of a small gong announcing a big war. “Dono idhar. Shoes. Now.”

Haider came like a schoolboy called to the blackboard. Tabeenah came like a queen summoned by a minor kingdom. They did not look at each other.

“You will go out,” Ammi decreed, one hand on her hip, the other pointing at the gate as if it were geography homework. “Walk. Eat. Talk. Do not come back until you both get normal.”

“What is normal?” asked Haider, because cowards ask for definitions.

“Not this,” Ammi replied, and that closed the dictionary.

Jaisha slid into the room as if wearing Ammi’s tone for sport. “Go,” she said, widening her eyes theatrically. “You both are not allowed in the house for an hour. I am the bouncer. I will card you for smiles.”

Bilal, solemn with the power of enforcement, handed them each a paper ticket he had made with crayons. “This is your pass for outside. Valid for one hour. Fine for fighting: one kulfi for me.”

“Robbery,” Haider murmured, already grateful for such a law.

The gate was delighted to have a role. It squared its shoulders and prepared to be a clock. It opened with a theatrical sigh that meant: I will time you, I will judge you, I will also creak like an old man if you try to sneak back early.

They stepped out. The street met them with its usual chorus, radios scolding and flirting, a bicycle bell trying to cut a polite path, a vendor singing the virtues of his guavas as if they were saints. The afternoon lay heavy, waiting for the first hint of evening to loosen its belt.

They walked in parallel, like two lines that did not believe in Euclid.

“Left or right?” Haider asked, too soft.

“Walk,” said Tabeenah. Direction was a luxury.

They reached the corner where the barber’s mirror had reflected generations of men becoming brave. A kite tugged at a string above them, practising restraint. The smell of frying samosas performed a sermon.

“Chaat,” said Haider, pointing with the humility of a pilgrim asking permission. “From Bhaiyya under the banyan?”

“Eat,” said Tabeenah, which was not yes but could be made into one.

They stood under the banyan whose roots had refused years ago to be only underground. The chaat-wala recognized family faces the way old cities do.

“Do thaal, extra imli, less mirch,” Haider ordered, then stopped and looked at her like a student checking an answer.

“More mirch,” corrected Tabeenah without looking at him. “And papri separate.”

“Apni marzi ki judge,” said the vendor, amused, mixing authority and potatoes. He handed them paper plates heavy as arguments.

They ate in the sturdy silence of people who have run out of clever. The imli bit down; the mirch voted to be parliament. A tear surprised Haider’s left eye, that old traitor; it slid out with ceremony.

“You always cry at imli,” said Tabeenah, and the sentence, so domestic, so unarmed, walked out into the air and stood there blinking, surprised to still know the way.

“Some losses,” he said, trying and failing to laugh, “are permanent.”

“Why did you put the chocolate on the shelf?” she asked, as if they were discussing spices.

“Because I wanted to say sorry without making you spend it on forgiving me,” he said. “Because I did not have the courage to ask for anything. Because if it stayed on the shelf, maybe you could take it without taking me with it.”

“Chocolate is not a bridge,” she said.

“I know,” he said. “But sometimes sugar keeps the bitter from closing the throat.”

They ate. He handed the napkin. She didn’t take it. He put it down on the corner of her plate and looked away. The banyan gave them shade the way a witness gives testimony: specific, unflinching.

They walked again. Past the stationery shop that still kept marbles no one bought. Past the school gate that had tried to raise more than children. Past the wall where he had painted her name badly once and Ammi had made him scrub it off with soap and apology.

“You tied my shoelaces together at Sports Day,” he said, not planning to.

“You hid my essay so I would cry,” she returned, remembering too fast.

“You stole my cricket ball and said ghost did it,” he said, with a crooked smile.

“That ghost... was on my side that day,” she said, and the smile in her voice startled them both.

At the bridge, the river came up to meet them like a story told every night and never finished. The water moved the way an elderly dancer does: with memory in every joint. Hawkers leaned against the railings, holding corn like torches. A boy with a camera offered them an instant photograph of themselves standing where they would rather not be seen.

Haider pulled a folded paper from his pocket—the boat Bilal had given him, its creases remembering small fingers. He held it like a shy confession.

“Bilal appointed me Minister of Boats,” he said. “No racing. Only picnics.”

“Only picnics,” she agreed, taking the boat from him and smoothing its spine. She wrote with her nail along the top edge, the letters invisible but felt. For Ismail.

They leaned over together and set the boat down on the steady unrest. It rocked like something too light for this world and then found, miraculously, a way forward. They watched it become smaller until it was just a rule they had made and released.

“Surah Fatiha?” he asked, throat low.

She nodded. Their voices folded over the water. The traffic behind them softened by instinct, as if afraid to be rude to the dead. When they finished, she did not wipe her eyes; she let the breeze do it.

“I have said a stupid sentence to you,” he said after a while. “Forget that. I take it back. There is no forgetting. There is only carrying. I will carry what I did. I won’t ask you to lift it for me.”

“Good,” she said. “Because I won’t.”

“I was the one who said ‘one more’,” he went on, laying bricks where words might bear weight. “I was the one who believed skill was bigger than consequence. I turned a road into a blade. I am still here. He is not. I don’t know how to live with that except to make my living careful. Give me rules. Let me work for what I broke.”

She looked at his hands on the railing, a familiar map she had refused to consult for years. “Three rules,” she said, because structure was what pride wears when it agrees to try. “No speed. Not in stories, not in engines, not in jokes. You do not prove anything with fast.”

“Done,” he said. The river nodded, stamping the document with its thumbprint.

“Second,” she continued. “Visible. You tell me when you leave, when you arrive. You do not disappear because men think disappearing is romance.”

“I will be visible,” he said, smiling a little at the memory of vows. “To you, to Ammi, to time.”

“Third.” She paused. This was the one with teeth. “You come with me to his grave. You say his name. You don’t let me say it alone anymore.”

His mouth opened, then closed, then opened again like a poor fish handed its last chance at river. “When?” he asked, like a man asking for the date of judgment.

“Tomorrow,” she said. “Before Zohr.”

“I will be there,” he said. “I will be on time.”

“And,” she added, because forgiveness, like chaat, is better with something extra, “you will eat what I order without argument for three outings.”

He laughed then, a sound that limped and still somehow reached the finish line. “Even if it is bitter gourd?”

“Especially if it is bitter gourd.”

They bought corn from the hawker and stood biting it like two separate suns. A boy ran past with a kite that had decided to be arrogant; it crashed into Haider’s shoulder and apologized in high Urdu. He handed it back and said, “No racing,” and the boy nodded as if given a prophecy.

On the way back, they stopped for kulfi because Bilal’s law is the only law that consistently works. The kulfi man carved cold into coins. They ate with the concentration of people rendering a verdict on time. A little streak of saffron colored the corner of her mouth; he wordlessly offered the napkin again; this time she took it.

“Say it,” she said, suddenly, as they turned onto their street.

“What?” he asked, guilty of many words.

“My name,” she said. “Not Apa. Not queen. Just my name.”

“Tab...” he began, then corrected himself to the full. “Tabeenah.”

She let the syllables land and then folded them neatly. “Good,” she said. “Now say yours.”

“Haider,” he said, surprised.

“You are my brother,” she said, as if reinstating a title after suspension. “Not my enemy. Not my flaw. My brother. Behave accordingly.”

“I will,” he said, which was both promise and job description.

They reached the gate. It checked the sky like a clock and clucked its tongue. An hour had been not exactly an hour but whose hour is it anyway when a house has sent you to buy normal? The hinges performed their old duet.

At the door, Jaisha blocked them with two fingers held up like a traffic policeman. “Password,” she demanded.

“Tamarind tears,” said Haider, wiping a last imaginary one.

“Only picnics,” said Tabeenah, and that was a key the lock recognized.

Ammi looked up from the kitchen, where the onion was once again being convinced to surrender. She saw two people return, carrying corn cobs like evidence and a silence that had softened its edges. “Normal?” she asked, not smiling, because smiling would make it too easy.

“Normal enough to sit on the same charpai without breaking it,” said Tabeenah.

“Normal enough to eat karela if she orders it,” said Haider, displaying his tongue, gilded with saffron, as a passport.

“Good,” Ammi said, allowing herself one nod and the smallest legal smile. “Wash hands. Maghrib soon.”

Bilal collected his fine with the fairness of a king. “Where is my kulfi?”

“Already inside you,” Haider said, tapping the boy’s cheerful stomach.

“Corruption,” Bilal declared, and the house laughed the way old houses do, by letting the light in easier.

Later, when the azan stitched the edges of evening together, when Abbu cleared his throat and called for tea, when Rizwan came back from the station with the smell of photocopies and resolve, when Rehana texted All calm for now, keep doors easy but closed, the boat on the river reached a bend no one could see from the bridge and still did not sink.

Normal, they discovered, was not a destination with a signboard. It was a path lit one bulb at a time. Tonight, two streetlights flickered on. They would hold. And if they trembled, there were hands nearby, ready to steady them until the electricity remembered its manners.
