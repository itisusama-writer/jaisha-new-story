Title: "Chapter 5 - After Hours"
---

By morning the crescent of charcoal had become a small decision on her thumb. She wore it to class the way some people wore rings to make a promise to themselves: visible, deniable.

She tried to draw. The pencil felt like a wire live with someone else’s current, the paper like a thing that might answer her back. The page where the five dots had appeared the day before was lying open like a breath half-held. She closed the sketchbook gently and went to the window.

The jacaranda had made a light mistake of the ground again. Petals like letters nobody had taught her to read kept landing where they liked.

“Try him now,” said Tabeenah from the sink, voice the practical edge of love. “Before he goes to work. Before you chicken out and make a whole meal out of not-knowing.”

Jaisha found her husband’s Dubai number with a thumb that had a memory of its own. The international tone trilled into a neat, sterile silence. Then a machine informed her in a voice as pleasant as a nurse that the number was “temporarily unavailable.”

She let the call end. Let the phone rest its glowing face against her thigh, as if it were gossiping there.

“Network,” said Tabeenah, rinsing a mug. “Sometimes Dubai is allergic to being reached. Try the other one.”

“The other one,” repeated Jaisha, as if they were discussing another moon. She scrolled down to the Pakistan number he had kept even after he moved, a relic for bank OTPs and wedding invites.

She pressed call.

This one didn’t make a production out of it. It rang like a doorbell. Twice, then three times, then:

“Jai?” Her husband’s voice: not-woke-up-yet, full of the cotton of a dawn he was on the wrong side of. “Sab theek? Time dekha hai?”

“I know,” she said, soft. The way she said I know to Bilal when he insisted the moon was following their car. “Did you...”

She stopped. The words were feral; they would run the wrong way if she opened the gate the wrong way.

“Did you what?” His awake came in quickly. “Is Bilal okay?”

“Did you send me a video?”

“A video?” He yawned and turned away from the mic; she could hear the small kindness of that movement. “When?”

“Last night.” She watched her sister pretend to find a spoon. “Today. The night and day are arguing, I don’t know.”

“No,” he said, immediate, then a softer curiosity: “Why? Someone sent you something?”

“And did you send any parcel? Like... courier?” Her voice had to climb over the shape of the word to get to him.

“From Dubai?” he laughed, the ridiculousness of logistics a comfort to him. “On what salary, madam? No. Why? You’re being strange. Jai. Kya hua? Batao.”

Here was the edge. You could stand on it and look at the river, or you could jump in and let the cold take your breath.

“Nothing,” she said. “Studio stuff. They rescheduled a criticism for no reason and then the teacher got flu and then suddenly didn’t. It’s the same university story in every country. I just... I thought maybe you had sent something, that’s all.”

“Of course I’ll send something,” he said, immediate in a different way now, inflamed by love. “When salary comes, I’ll send you both an ugly handbag and a beautiful regret.”

She smiled the way you smile at a photo. “Okay.”

“Send me Bilal’s photo from today,” she added, gentler, as if catching a falling plate. “You always take one at breakfast. The one where he makes his chapati into a wheel.”

There was a small door inside her that she kept having to hold shut. If she told him, the whole day would become an argument about panic. He would imagine corridors he had never walked. He would try to fix geography with worry. He was good and she did not want to waste him on a ghost.

"Okay Jai... I will send you the picture. And hopefully we will meet soon. We are in Pakistan right now."

she said. “Go back to sleep. Or to work. Whichever your sins require.”

He sighed. “Call me later on the Pakistan number if you need anything... or discuss anything.”

“Okay.”

“I love you.”

“Hmm,” she said. The syllable that could carry a thousand things across a small bridge. “Me too.”

When she cut the call, the room had a different shape of quiet. The kind that made you think of all the silhouettes of all the women who had ever said nothing because what would saying things even do.

She looked at the giraffe on the shelf. Its cheap yellow had become a new color overnight. The scuff on its ear was not a birthmark; it was an event. She could see the moment it had happened as if she were replaying a small film on the surface of the plastic: the fall in the mall, the slick floor, the surprised little betrayal of gravity, her child’s outrage so large it had borrowed the whole atrium and made it echo. A stranger’s lollipop appearing like a magic trick adults always knew.

“Say it isn’t his,” she told herself. She turned the giraffe over as if the factory had stamped a name into its belly. A smear of something sticky near one leg had a faint, impossible scent, the antiseptic of those wipes she used to clean Bilal’s hands, lemon pretending to be virtue.

“Coincidence,” said Tabeenah, not coming any closer. She kept speaking to the kitchen as if proximity were a spell the opposite of what people thought. “Sunday bazaar sells this in packets of ten. Every child in the city has fallen the same way.”

“Hmm,” said Jaisha again, and wanted to throw the toy out of the window and then go down the stairs and apologize to it and bring it back.

They were both quiet long enough for the world to intrude. Messages arrived about an assignment deadline that had moved itself like a cat on a shelf. Someone on the hostel group shared a poster for a blood donation drive. A meme took a small lap around the floor and lay down in the corner, exhausted.

At noon they went downstairs to ask the guard what it had pleased the night to do with itself.

His moustache looked like it had been praised too much for its courage and was now trying not to false-eyelash off his face. His ledger lay open like the holy book and equally unhelpful if you did not already believe. Twenty small lines of delivery signatures marched across it in a hand that, if you wanted to be paranoid, looked familiar.

“City Couriers,” said Jaisha, polite with the kind of politeness that made your tongue ache. “Who delivered parcel to 3-B the other night?”

“Night?” He arranged his face into a geography where no incorrect weather could be blamed on him. “Madam, deliveries are 9 to 7. After that the gate sleeps.”

“Then a dream knocked on our door at midnight with a male voice and correct pronunciation,” said Tabeenah, equally polite, equally pointed.

He passed a finger under a line on the ledger. It said: CITY C., 00:02, 3-B. Signed: War. He looked pleased with his own reading. “Warden sahiba.” He tapped the signature as if tapping would make the ridiculous true.

“Warden sahiba does not take deliveries,” said Jaisha. “That is the point.”

He shrugged in a way that moved the moustache like a separate creature. “You know rules. Men not allowed. So not man.”

“The voice was a man,” said Tabeenah. “Unless I have developed a phobia of shopkeepers.”

He did the thing you feared guards would do: he grew bored inside his own job. “Toh what to do? You put complaint. You write. I’ll staple it. The staple will be tight. The paper will feel secure.”

“CCTV?” asked Jaisha, feeling both childish and dangerous at the same time.

He brightened; here was a gadget he could have an opinion about. “CCTV is always recording,” he said, then ruined it with, “But the power had some drama.” He made the rolling hand motion men made to mean This is Pakistan, accept your portion. “We will check. Come after lunch.”

They took the staircase back up like two women who had made a pact not to be ridiculous and had immediately tripped over their own pact.

In the room, they postponed everything by inventing tasks. They rearranged the shelf. They pretended the beds would be improved by being made. They discussed whether the potted money-plant in the corner was a money-plant or a bye-bye-plant. Lunch arrived the way it always did: late, correct, wearing a sheen of oil like a plan no one would ever question.

At four, because boredom had made their courage cheap, they went to see the Warden.

Warden sahiba had a face like an administrative building: all windows and no questioning of whether the foundation was floodplain. She had not signed anything, she said, and voice-signed her own denial into the hallway for others to borrow. Men were not allowed into the hostel after seven or before eight unless they were plumbers, electricians. She looked offended at the universe for offering alternatives.

“We had a knock,” said Jaisha, trying to make her voice less interesting. “At midnight. Twice, two nights.”

“Courier,” supplied Tabeenah.

“Maybe that where you live, they do these dramatics,” said the Warden, gently condescending without meaning malice. “Here, simple things happen at simple times.”

“The ledger says...” began Jaisha.

“The ledger says what men like to make lines say when they don’t want to think about the meaning between them,” said the Warden. “I did not sign. If your guard wants to make my name an umbrella, tell him umbrellas are for rain, not for tears.”

“CCTV?” said Tabeenah, not sure whether she was mocking the universe or courting it.

“Always recording,” said Warden sahiba, and smiled in a way that told you she had said that sentence daily for years and had never once seen it have any effect on anything alive.

They watched the footage on her twelve-inch monitor. The hallway outside 3-B became a movie of unhelpful facts. The time-stamp in the top corner ticked the way clocks tick in films where nothing will happen until it does. At 00:02, the corridor grain shifted, some tiny change in exposure the way a breath changes the light on a glass. The frame did a hiccup. On the far end, by the stairs, a shadow lengthened and shortened like a mind changing itself. Then the file jumped like a goat: 00:02 to 00:14, skipping the minutes the way people skip shame.

“Power,” said the Warden, satisfied, as if she had just diagnosed a common cold. “What to do.”

They walked back to their room in a new weather. The air in the corridor was the temperature of decisions. A girl from Psychology passed again, this time smelling of stress and perfume both. Someone had drawn a small flower on the notice board with a marker whose ink was dying.

When they closed the door, its click sounded like a promise: we will keep out nothing, but with confidence.

“Yeh allowed nahin hai,” said Tabeenah finally, almost cheerful with outrage. “Men not allowed. We say this how many times? So who did courier? And why night? How enter? From the window like a cat? Warden jih had this in security briefing? ‘Beware of felines bearing packages’?”

“Maybe it wasn’t a man,” said Jaisha, then, to her own cowardice: “Maybe that makes it worse.”

They both laughed the nervous laugh of people who were trying to make the room inhabit them instead of the other way round.

At 6:11 p.m., a message arrived on Tabeenah’s phone. The same small intimacy. The same sense of a mouth near an ear.

Unknown: Don’t worry. You don’t even have to open the door.

She stared at the words as if they were a drawing she could blur by looking harder. Her thumb hovered. She tried to screenshot. The screen blinked the way a shy thing blinks when you look at it too directly. The picture saved as a rectangle of darkness. When she flipped back to the message, the chat had become a blank small room. A clock icon, an empty head.

Delete.

She looked at her sister. “Jai.” She didn’t need to add the rest. The rest was the shape of her mouth. Her hand.

“Show me,” said Jaisha, then the uselessness of the verb made her swallow it. “What did it say?”

“Don’t worry,” said Tabeenah. She laughed once, a tiny, venomless thing. “That is the funniest thing anyone has ever said.”

They sat without moving, as if motion might shake loose something that had been carefully placed.

Unknown had not knocked tonight. Unknown had learned patience. Or boredom.

At 7:03 p.m., the jacaranda did its daily trick, dropping one long petal that looked like a fingernail. At 8:20 p.m., they pretended dinner was medicine. At 10, the hostel group exploded with an argument about whether playing Ludo in the hallway constituted a moral failure.

“I’m thinking,” said Jaisha into the soup of the evening. “What if he, what if this...”

“This,” said her sister firmly, “is a coward who found a ladder.”

“Ladder to where?”

“To between,” said Tabeenah, tasting the word for its truth. “Between the gate and the guard. Between the rule and the exception. Between yes and no. That’s where creeps live. It’s not even a place, it’s a habit.”

“Yeh hai kon or kyun kar raha ye sab...” She heard herself say it before she could ask permission of the room. The language curled itself around the question like an arm. She was surprised by how ordinary the words looked after everything. As if villains could be named as easily as vegetables on a list.
