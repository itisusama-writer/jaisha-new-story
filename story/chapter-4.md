Title: "Chapter 4 - New Shape of Proof"
---

By Maghrib, the sky had turned the exact lilac strangers always told her she looked “nice” in. She texted Tabeenah: On my way. A vendor threaded through with boiled eggs in a glass case, the whites shining like eyes.

At the hostel gate, the guard had a new moustache. It made him look like a photo of himself pinned to himself. He waved her through as if there was nothing else to do.

On their door, a package leaned like a tired guest. Brown paper, tied with coarse string, the kind that cut if you weren’t careful. A small card was stuck under the string: For: Ms. Tabeenah Ilyas. From: City Couriers. 00:02 AM.

She checked her watch: 7:13 PM. “They delivered at midnight?” she said aloud. The guard’s ledger had no note. “Who signed?”

The guard lifted a shoulder. “Maybe Warden sahiba took it.”

Warden sahiba did not take deliveries. That was the point of warden sahibas.

Inside, she waited for her sister to return from the store. She stared at the package the way you stare at a stray dog: with love, with distrust. The lid of her laptop glowed gently on the desk as if asleep.

Her phone buzzed as she reached toward the string.

Unknown: Don’t peek. Gifts are sweeter when the right hand opens them.

Delete.

She snatched her hand back like it had been slapped.

“Who is it?” called Tabeenah from the corridor, breathless with bags and indignation. “I asked for coriander and the aunty gave me mint. Aga... oh.” Her eyes traveled to the package. “This for me?”

The card said so. The card did not say why. She saw the moment her sister chose bravery like a coat and put it on.

“Bismillah,” said Tabeenah, and tugged the string. It released with that satisfying little bite. Inside: tissue paper, carefully folded. When she lifted it, a gentle rain of something soft fell onto the bedspread.

Jacaranda petals. Dozens, maybe a hundred, pressed flat, their lilac turned paper-brittle. In the center of the box, a single charcoal stick. The kind Jaisha used. The kind that snapped if you pressed too hard.

“Who sends petals?... and why the charcol stil. I don't do art.” said Tabeenah, trying for a joke, failing. “Allergies?... It's definitely yours.”

At the bottom of the box, a slip of paper no larger than a ticket stub. In careful, school-teacher pen: For sleep.

They stared at it until the words were no longer words.

“I’m...” said Jaisha, and stopped. “I should go see the warden.”

“She’ll tell us to pray and lock the door,” said her sister, voice tight. “Pray anyway.”

They carried the box to the desk together as if it were heavy, as if effort could make it legitimate. The Jacaranda in her drawing on the wall looked suddenly insufficient to the task of beauty. The real thing was everywhere, and everywhere arranged.

They ate nothing. The banana browned in its skin. Outside, the hostel traded the clatter of day for the thin noises of night. Someone laughed for too long on a phone call. A motorbike worried at the gate and then went off into the street.

At midnight, they were both awake, backs against the same wall, pretending to be doing different things. The fan skimmed their thoughts thin. When someone knocked... a brisk, bureaucratic knock, they both flinched and then looked at each other like children caught playing.

“Courier,” came a man’s voice, uninterested. “Parcel for Room 3-B. I left it outside earlier.”

“Go away,” said Tabeenah before she could stop herself. “You can’t deliver at this time!”

“Already delivered,” said the voice, in the unusual tense of someone who had learned how to irritate. His footsteps retreated. Or pretended to.

They didn’t open the door. They waited until the waiting became a third person in the room. Finally, at 00:26, as if obeying a prayer she hadn’t remembered making, her phone stuttered.

Unknown: Sleep. It’s your best defense.

Delete.

She did not sleep. Even when her eyes closed, they remained open on the inside.

At 3:17 a.m., when the night was thinnest and the call to prayer had not yet tugged at the edges of the city, her phone vibrated with an intimacy that felt like a mouth near her ear.

A video.

She pressed play because not pressing was worse.

The frame: a darkened room. The soft grain of a phone camera in low light. A digital time stamp in the upper left corner: 03:17. The small sound of someone’s hand adjusting the phone near a cotton sleeve. Then the bed came into focus.

Bilal, asleep on his side, breath rising and falling in small ripples. The strip of fraying blue on his pajama collar where he insisted on worrying it with his teeth. A stuffed giraffe jammed half under his tummy. The shadow of a curtain moving in an air-conditioned sigh. The door’s edge, visible only because the glow from the phone caught the paint, off-white and scuffed at toddler height.

A hand, adult, careful, entered the frame for a moment. Not to touch. To adjust the giraffe so the child’s cheek rested on it properly. The gesture was so gentle it made her bones ache.

Audio: a hush that could have been the word shh or just the room resting.

She watched it twice. On the second watch, she looked for the thing she could say made it old. The old duvet, the old pillowcase, the wallpaper the landlord had changed. But everything was unhelpfully timeless: a child sleeping looks like every child in every room in every country.

She grabbed a screenshot. The phone blinked, and the thumbnail was black. The time stamp didn’t save. When she reopened the message, the video was gone.

Delete.

She tried to call her husband. The call failed. International rates. Night. He would wake scared and scold her for worrying alone, and then the dawn would come and the day would be ruined at both ends of the world. She held the phone to her chest until she could feel her heart beating through it like it was the one that needed reassurance.

“Jai?” whispered Tabeenah, not sleeping either. “Kya hua?”

“Nothing,” she lied, strangled by love. “False alarm.”

The rest of the night went on forever and then suddenly ended, as nights do.

Silence held for a day.

It was not a white, peaceful silence. It was a trained dog waiting for a command. Every time her phone didn’t ping, the not-ping landed like a pebble in her skull. She forgot to answer messages from studio mates because she was listening for something that did not come. She forgot to eat again and told herself the door would be enough to keep the world out and then checked the bolt even though it was obviously engaged. She checked it again.

They took turns pretending the courier had been a mistake. They put the petals back in the box and shut the lid firmly like you do to stop a genie from escaping. They made tea. They did not drink it hot. The world of campus moved around her in the big, practical way of institutions: announcements on notice boards that did not care what the skin felt, emails about timetable changes that arrived with the helplessness of government.

In the evening, to prove the city did not own their throats, they took a short walk to the small shop for toothpaste and chips. They walked back close together without touching. On the third-floor landing, a girl from Psychology breezed past wearing a green scarf and the smell of something expensive.

When they reached their door, a small plastic thing sat on the mat.

It was a toy giraffe, cheap, the yellow already tired, the paint a little drunk on the eyes. What stopped Jaisha wasn’t what it was but the way the ear had a scuff in the shape of a small crescent. Bilal’s had the same scuff, made by a fall in a mall that had made him cry until a stranger bought him a lollipop and the world recommenced.

“People buy these in every Sunday bazaar,” said Tabeenah, softly, like stepping on a dream.

“It’s the ear,” said Jaisha, and hated her own mouth for saying it.

A neighbor’s door opened a crack. “Ajeeb cheezain,” the neighbor observed, curious in that safe, useless way of people who lived two feet away and nowhere near. “Are you a child.” she said to Jaisha and closed the door.

“Hmm,” said Tabeenah brightly. “Who put it here?” She picked the toy up with two fingers and set it on the bookshelf facing inward like a punishment.

They didn’t speak for a long time. Then, because normal life insists itself even on the edges of madness, they discussed laundry. They argued about whether to buy the expensive rice. They both laughed at something deeply unfunny on TV.

At 10 p.m., the hostel WhatsApp group announced the water would be off from 11 to 2 “for reasons.” A dozen groans flooded the chat. Below it, the Unknown’s name did not appear. It didn’t have to. The group profile picture was a sunrise someone had stolen from the internet. The admin’s gloss of authority did not soothe.

At 11, the taps coughed themselves empty. The fan cut out and resumed with the belligerent whim of Pakistani electricity. Somewhere below, someone sang off-key. The night had the soft fur of something pretending to purr.

At 12:07 a.m., the knock came again.

“Courier,” said the same disinterested voice, as if the day in between had been a breath held and released. “For 3-B. Sorry. Forgot the invoice.”

“Leave it there,” said Tabeenah, calm now in a way that made Jaisha want to hold onto her ankle so she wouldn’t float away. “We’ll take it in the morning.”

They waited. No footsteps lingered. They didn’t open the door. They were learning to live like jars.

At 12:21 a.m., her phone lit up like a fish’s belly.

Unknown: Good girls.

Delete.

She slept, eventually, the way the hunted sleep: in stamps, in rations. She dreamed of petals arranged into alphabets she could not read.

---

She woke with a sense of a hand on her shoulder. There was no hand. The day had already begun itself into the kind of busy that left a person too tired to worry. She would be grateful for that later, she thought. She would be grateful for the way a bureaucracy could plod. She washed her face. She reached for her sketchbook.

On page seven, which she had not touched in a week because the paper had a snag along the top edge that irritated her, a charcoal fingerprint sat like the world’s smallest moon. In the margin, five little dots lined up in a neat row.

She put the book down gently as if it contained an egg.

“Jai?” said her sister, tying her hair up with a rubber band she’d stolen from the broccoli. “You’re white.”

“Come,” said Jaisha. She showed her the page. “Tell me you did this.”

“I didn’t,” said Tabeenah. Then, because she was good, she said, “We need to tell someone.”

“We did,” said Jaisha. “We told the box. We told the petals. We told the projector. We told the guard with his moustache. We told the lift. They all said the same thing: nobody remembers.”

“Warden?” said her sister.

“Will say the same,” said Jaisha, grief sharp as a cough. “They will say: where is your proof?”

The word lay between them, heavy and ridiculous. As if anyone who survived anything had ever had proof on time.

Her phone buzzed. She didn’t move.

Unknown: Proof is a kind of cruelty. You don’t need it. I do.

Delete.

She laughed once, the kind of laugh that makes people turn their heads. “Stay with me tonight,” she said to her sister, even though they already lived two beds apart. “Just... sit, if I wake up.”

“I have been,” said Tabeenah.

The fan hummed. The jacaranda outside shed one more petal and then another, slow, deliberate, like a tutorial. In the space where the world was supposed to be made of facts, a different architecture was being built: petals and fingerprints and glitches and a child’s scuffed giraffe all leaning together, each one vanishing as soon as she tried to show it to anyone who didn’t already believe.

At the door, the giraffe sat on the shelf facing inward, as if sulking. On the bed, the box breathed petals.

Between one step and the next, between the lift and their door, between her and the rest of the life she had planned for herself, the room of her head had changed shape. She reached for her pencil and held it the way you hold a tool and a weapon both.

On the edge of the desk, the charcoal snapped in her fingers. It left a black crescent on her skin.

She did not wash it off.
