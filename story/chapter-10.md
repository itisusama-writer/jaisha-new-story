Title: Chapter 10 - The Obdience
---

The jacaranda kept making its purple mess like an apology that had learned choreography. The fans above the classroom wrote circles on the air until the air bored of being a circle. The bell practiced being a bell. The door, pleased with its promotion to guardian, kept listening.

They moved. The corridor tried on normal again, found it tight at the shoulders, took it off. The green scarf girl shadowed them with her eyes, harvesting the day for later. The braid walked behind like a warning braided into hair. The guard at the hostel gate gave his mustache permission to salute. He did not ask the mustache if it wanted to.

They went to the library, it smelled like paper had turned into bread. Books leaned against each other like older cousins pretending not to gossip. A librarian looked up, a pair of spectacles that had learned to be a person, and did not ask anything. She stamped the silence to make it official.

They took a table by another door. Of course they did. A dictionary watched them using the side of its eye like a chaperone. The fans rehearsed their spell again, as if repetition could convince the day to become a day.

The phone lay face down like a fish pretending to be stone. It vibrated. It was a stone that remembered the sea.

“Answer,” breathed the braid, the word turning to a small ring that rolled to Jaisha and settled around her wrist.

They did. The screen filled with a slant of light caught in cloth; the slope of that black sleeve; a line of cheek below a mask; the suggestion of a place that was trying not to be a place. Then a soft scuffle. A child’s shoe with a dinosaur on the side flashed, brave and silly. Bilal’s mouth again, sticky with the ghost of something sweet. He was not crying. This was, for now, the kindness.

“Good girls,” said the man, indulgent, spinning his voice like sugar. “New room. New door. Ready for a lesson?”

“No lessons,” said Tabeenah, her voice an invitation that had decided to be a wall.

“Everything is a lesson if you are not lazy,” he said. “Jaisha, are you listening, or are you hiding under the table of your sister’s words?”

“I’m here,” said Jaisha. The iron was there; it refused to rust for him.

“Say hello to your mother,” the man told Bilal.

“Mama,” said Bilal, as if the word had a ribbon. “I won the race. He said I am fastest.”

“What race?” asked Jaisha, and her mouth tried to fight her voice for custody of breath.

“Shh,” said the man, almost kindly. “We make games so time does not murder us. We are generous. We do not let him watch our counting. Do not insult a boy’s joy. Do not feed guilt to him; it is not a fruit.”

“I want to see him,” said Jaisha.

“You are seeing him,” the man said, turning the camera to show a cheek, a blink, a forehead with a star-shaped sticker that did the job of a star. “Do you know why he has this sticker?”

“Because he is good,” said Jaisha, the words walking barefoot over glass.

“Because he cried and then he stopped when I told him to,” said the man. “He learns. You should learn. You keep your salt out of the phone. Remember? Or the lesson will be... wetter.”

“We remember,” said Tabeenah, dry as chalk. “You remember the rules too.”

“Ah, rules,” he said, sweet as a nail dipped in honey. “Rule today: the sister will cry, but not the boy. Crying is a tax. Who pays? Not him. Not me. You.”

“No,” said Jaisha.

“Yes,” said the man. “Now listen to the hum.”

He tilted the phone and let silence be a machine. Under the nowhere of the blue sky, under the mutter of city-throat, a sound wheezed: a generator, breath cracked at the edges, the exact pitched snore of something that had been asked for too much.

The phone in Tabeenah’s other hand pulsed. Rehana, all verbs.

Rehana: Audio confirms. This is that asthma generator. Two parks on the list. Model Town side. And one behind the old cinema. We are sending uncles who pretend to be uncles. Also: line up school bells at noon. Echo maps are hungry today.

"He wants her to cry." Tabeenah said, confused.

The reply dot thought, argued with itself.

Rehana: No crying if you can help it. But if you must, cry into a handkerchief not into the microphone. Your grief is not his property. Hold your voice. Let your eyes do the flood work in private.

The other screen waited, the man’s quiet offering itself like a napkin to a mess. He knew the hum had been heard the way a hunter knows when a leaf is pretending to be a bird.

“Shall we begin?” he asked. “Jaisha, tell me something you love.”

“My son,” she said, and the word was a house that had been lit from the inside. The brightness cut her.

“Of course,” he said. “Now say: I should not have named him after a hero. It makes men curious.”

She did not speak. The silence creaked.

“Say it,” he said, still in that teacher’s patient cruelty. “We are practicing humility. Humility makes you soft. Soft things are easier to keep.”

“I will not,” she said.

He turned the camera. Bilal’s small hand lay on a black cloth. The cloth could have been a knee, a lap, a table that had agreed to behave. On the boy’s index finger, a bandage with a cartoon lion, king of tiny hurts. He was tracing the lion with the seriousness children give to kings.

“Mama,” he said, the two syllables like a seesaw that had figured out balance. “He will buy me another ice cream if I am brave.”

“You don’t need to be brave for ice cream,” said Jaisha, and there it was, a first wetness lifting into her throat, heavy and obvious as a small boat.

“You hear how she disobeys?” the man told the child, stage-pretend, a joke wearing boots. “She tells stories to your courage.”

“Mama,” said Bilal again, as if he had discovered the sweetest sound in the universe and was not going to let it escape. “Uncle has a very fast kite.”

Somewhere, a kite learned embarrassment.

“Enough,” said the braid quietly. Her palm touched the back of Jaisha’s chair and turned into gravity. “Keep your salt.”

“Show me the park,” said Tabeenah. “Show me a wall. Show me a tree.”

“No,” the man said, amused. “Today we show you your face.”

He turned the phone to reflective glass. For a gasp of a second, the mirror made by the screen made by the phone made by the man became a loop, and there were the sisters: two women who had collected a night in their eyes and taught it to sit. The braid behind them like punctuation. A background of books staring like witnesses. The lion bandage in the corner like a crown for a country that had misplaced its map.

“Say it,” he said. “Say: Men are not allowed. You are warned. And then make one tear. Just one. A small ceremony. Then we will let the boy nap. He has earned a nap.”

“Men are not allowed,” Jaisha said, voice made of iron that had learned to be foil and refused. “You are warned.”

The tear did not arrive. It rehearsed. It chewed on its cue. It did not perform.

The man laughed a little, like a coin that had been dropped on a floor and was deciding whether to roll under a cabinet. “Stubborn,” he said. “It is attractive when it is not expensive.”

The screen went black.

The film of the library resumed. The librarian cut paper with her eyes. A student walked past with a stack of pages that wanted to be theories and were mostly caffeine.

Rehana: Park teams in place in ten minutes. If he is moving, he is stupid; if he is still, he is ours.

Rehana: Also... we are whispering to the power company. They will sneeze out a schedule. If the hum stutters, we will be looking at the right crescent of town. Patience and mean.

“Water,” said Warden, and a bottle appeared like a conjurer’s apology. “Drink. Keeping the body ordinary helps.”

They drank. The water turned into something that remembered being a river.

Another buzz. Not the number. A different unknown, the same emptiness.

Unknown: Stand. Walk to the window. Five steps. Look at the purple tree. Smile. Wave. We count waves. You are in a book. Do as told.

“Don’t,” said the braid, not looking up. “We wave to no one unless we choose.”

Unknown: He is listening for your happiness. He needs a sample.

“Block it,” said Warden.

“We don’t block criminnals,” said the braid, with a smile that contained a bite. “We learn their weather and carry umbrellas.”

They didn’t wave. The jacaranda was generous anyway. Outside, a boy on a bicycle rang his bell as if he had been hired to be the city’s heartbeat.

Their hour inside the library broke and was mended and broke again. The fans confessed to their whirring. Tabeenah checked her other phone like a farmer checking clouds.

Rehana: Choosing Model Town Park. The hum has a neighbor: a crow choir, 2 p.m., I remember. Also... we hear school bell in D-flat. Tells me the east gate side. Sending a hawker with gol gappay. He is our best liar. He can lie with salt water.

Rehana: And... plainclothes outside husband’s office report he fainted without a sofa. We gave him a chair. He is very human today.

"Keep him unheroic. It helps." Tabeena said.

The next call did not ring. It bloomed. The same number, the same mouth.

“Good girls,” he said. “We have been watching you not wave. Ten points.”

“How many points does he have?” asked Jaisha.

“Enough to buy a nap,” he said. “But. I am disappointed. You refuse to cry. Is your stubbornness more precious than your boy’s nap? He is small. He needs rules enforced.”

Something in her face slipped. It was small. You would not have noticed unless you had been training for this sport. Her mouth was a house that lost one window.

“Say it,” he said. “Say: I am learning obedience.”

“We are learning patience,” said Tabeenah. “It’s in the syllabus.”

“Ah,” he said. “So then let's teach you why men are not allowed.”
